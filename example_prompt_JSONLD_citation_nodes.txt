CEDRIC  KUSHNER  PROMOTIONS,  LTD. v. KING
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 00-549.  Argued April 18, 2001-Decided June 11, 2001
Petitioner, a corporate promoter of boxing matches, sued Don King, the
president and sole shareholder of a rival corporation, alleging that King
had conducted his corporation's affairs in violation of the Racketeer In-
fluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which makes it "unlaw-
ful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise ...  to
conduct  or participate  . . . in the  conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity,"  18 U. S. C. § 1962(c).  The
District Court, citing Circuit precedent, dismissed the complaint.  In
affirming, the Second Circuit expressed its view that § 1962(c) applies
only where a plaintiff shows the existence  of two separate entities, a
"person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of which that "person"
improperly conducts.  In this instance, the court noted, it was undis-
puted that King was an employee  of his corporation and also acting
within the scope of his authority.  Under the court's analysis, King, in
a legal sense, was part of the corporation, not a "person," distinct from
the "enterprise," who allegedly improperly conducted the "enterprise's
affairs."
Held: In the circumstances  of this case, § 1962(c) requires no more than
the formal legal distinction between "person" and "enterprise" (namely,
incorporation); hence, the provision applies when a corporate employee
unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole
owner-whether he conducts those affairs within the scope, or beyond
the scope, of corporate authority.  This Court does not quarrel with the
basic principle that to establish liability under § 1962(c) one must allege
and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2)
an "enterprise" that is not simply the same "person" referred to by a
different name.  Nonetheless, the  Court disagrees  with the appellate
court's application of that "distinctness" principle to the present circum-
stances,  in which a  corporate  employee,  acting within  the scope  of
his authority, allegedly conducts the corporation's  affairs in a RICO-
forbidden way.  The corporate owner/employee, a natural person, is dis-
tinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different
rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status.  The Court
can find nothing in RICO that requires more "separateness" than that.

Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts his corporation's af-
fairs through illegal acts comes within § 1962(c)'s terms forbidding any
"person" unlawfully to conduct an "enterprise," particularly when RICO
explicitly defines "person" to include "any individual...  capable of hold-
ing a legal or beneficial interest in property," and defines "enterprise"
to include a "corporation,"  §§ 1961(3), (4).  And, linguistically speaking,
the employee and the corporation are different "persons,"  even where
the employee is the corporation's sole owner.  Incorporation's basic pur-
pose is to create a legal entity distinct from those natural individuals
who created the corporation, who own  it, or whom it employs.  See,
e. g.,  United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U. S.5 1, 61-62.  The precedent on
which the Second Circuit relied involved significantly different circum-
stances from those here at issue.  Further, to apply RICO in these cir-
cumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes of protecting
both a legitimate "enterprise" from those who would use unlawful acts
to victimize  it, United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 591,  and the
public from those who would unlawfully use an "enterprise" (whether
legitimate or illegitimate) as a "vehicle" through which unlawful activity
is committed, National Organizationf or Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510
U. S.2 49, 259.  Conversely, the appellate court's  critical legal distinc-
tion-between employees acting within and without the scope of corpo-
rate authority-would immunize from RICO liability many of those at
whom this Court has said RICO directly aims, e. g.,  high-ranking indi-
viduals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seeking to further
the  enterprise's  purposes,  act  within  the  scope  of their  authority,
cf. Turkette, supra,a t 581.  Finally, nothing in the statute's history sig-
nificantly favors an alternative interpretation.  This Court's rule is no
less consistent than is the lower court's rule with the following princi-
ples cited by King: (1) the principle that a corporation acts only through
its directors, officers, and agents;  (2) the principle that a corporation
should not be liable  for its employees'  criminal acts where Congress
so intends; and (3)  antitrust law's  intracorporate  conspiracy doctrine.

JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Racketeer  Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  Act
(RICO  or, Act),  18  U. S. C. § 1961 et seq., makes  it  "unlaw-
ful  for  any  person  employed  by  or  associated  with  any
enterprise..,  to conduct or participate...  in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs" through the commission of two or
more  statutorily defined crimes-which  RICO  calls "a pat-
tern  of  racketeering  activity."  § 1962(c).  The  language
suggests,  and  lower  courts  have  held,  that this  provision
foresees  two  separate  entities,  a  "person"  and  a  distinct
"enterprise."
This case focuses upon a person who is the president  and
sole shareholder of a closely held corporation.  The plaintiff
claims  that  the  president  has  conducted  the corporation's
affairs through the forbidden "pattern," though for present
purposes it is conceded that, in doing so, he acted within the
scope  of his  authority  as  the  corporation's  employee.  In
these circumstances,  are there two entities, a "person" and
a separate "enterprise"?  Assuming, as we must given the
posture of this case, that the allegations in the complaint are
true, we conclude  that the  "person" and  "enterprise" here
are distinct and that the RICO provision applies.
Petitioner, Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., is a corpora-
tion  that  promotes  boxing matches.  Petitioner  sued  Don
King, the president  and sole shareholder  of Don  King Pro-
ductions,  a  corporation,  claiming  that King  had  conducted
the boxing-related  affairs of Don  King Productions  in part
through a RICO "pattern," i. e., through the alleged commis-
sion of at least two instances of fraud and other RICO predi-

Association  of Securities  and  Commercial  Law  Attorneys  as  amicus
curiae urging reversal.

Opinion of the Court
cate  crimes.  The  District Court,  citing Court  of Appeals
precedent, dismissed the complaint.  Civ. No. 98-6859, 1999
WL 771366, *3-4 (SDNY, Sept. 28, 1999).  And the Court of
Appeals  affirmed that dismissal.  219 F. 3d  115 (CA2 2000)
(per curiam).  In the appellate court's view, § 1962(c) applies
only  where a plaintiff shows the existence  of two separate
entities, a "person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of
which  that "person" improperly conducts.  Id.,  at 116.  In
this instance, "it is undisputed that King was  an employee"
of the corporation  Don  King Productions  and  also "acting
within the scope of his authority."  Id., at 117.  Under the
Court of Appeals'  analysis, King, in a legal sense, was part
of, not separate from, the corporation.  There was no "per-
son,"  distinct from  the "enterprise,"  who  improperly  con-
ducted the "enterprise's affairs."  And thus § 1962(c)  did not
apply.  Ibid.
Other  Circuits, applying  § 1962(c)  in roughly  similar cir-
cumstances,  have reached  a contrary conclusion.  See, e. g.,
Brannon v. Boatmen's First Nat. Bank of Okla., 153 F. 3d
1144,1148, n. 4 (CA10 1998); Richmond v. Nationwide Cassel
L. P., 52 F. 3d 640, 647 (CA7 1995); JaguarC  ars, Inc. v. Royal
Oaks Motor Car Co., 46 F. 3d 258, 265, 269 (CA3 1995); Sever
v. Alaska Pulp Corp., 978 F. 2d 1529, 1534 (CA9 1992).  We
granted  certiorari  to  resolve  the conflict.  We  now  agree
with these Circuits and hold that the Second Circuit's inter-
pretation of § 1962(c) is erroneous.
We do not quarrel with the basic principle that to establish
liability under § 1962(c) one must allege and prove the exist-
ence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2) an "enter-
prise" that is not simply the same "person" referred  to by
a different name.  The statute's language, read as ordinary
English,  suggests  that  principle.  The  Act  says  that  it
applies to  "person[s]"  who are  "employed  by  or associated
with" the "enterprise."  § 1962(c).  In ordinary English one
speaks of employing, being employed by, or associating with
others, not oneself.  See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 132 (1993) (defining "associate"); id., at 743 (defin-
