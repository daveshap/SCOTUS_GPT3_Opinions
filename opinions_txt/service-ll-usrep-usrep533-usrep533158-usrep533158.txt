CEDRIC  KUSHNER  PROMOTIONS,  LTD. v. KING
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 00-549.  Argued April 18, 2001-Decided June 11, 2001
Petitioner, a corporate promoter of boxing matches, sued Don King, the
president and sole shareholder of a rival corporation, alleging that King
had conducted his corporation's affairs in violation of the Racketeer In-
fluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which makes it "unlaw-
ful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise ...  to
conduct  or participate  . . . in the  conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity,"  18 U. S. C. § 1962(c).  The
District Court, citing Circuit precedent, dismissed the complaint.  In
affirming, the Second Circuit expressed its view that § 1962(c) applies
only where a plaintiff shows the existence  of two separate entities, a
"person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of which that "person"
improperly conducts.  In this instance, the court noted, it was undis-
puted that King was an employee  of his corporation and also acting
within the scope of his authority.  Under the court's analysis, King, in
a legal sense, was part of the corporation, not a "person," distinct from
the "enterprise," who allegedly improperly conducted the "enterprise's
affairs."
Held: In the circumstances  of this case, § 1962(c) requires no more than
the formal legal distinction between "person" and "enterprise" (namely,
incorporation); hence, the provision applies when a corporate employee
unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole
owner-whether he conducts those affairs within the scope, or beyond
the scope, of corporate authority.  This Court does not quarrel with the
basic principle that to establish liability under § 1962(c) one must allege
and prove the existence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2)
an "enterprise" that is not simply the same "person" referred to by a
different name.  Nonetheless, the  Court disagrees  with the appellate
court's application of that "distinctness" principle to the present circum-
stances,  in which a  corporate  employee,  acting within  the scope  of
his authority, allegedly conducts the corporation's  affairs in a RICO-
forbidden way.  The corporate owner/employee, a natural person, is dis-
tinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity with different
rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status.  The Court
can find nothing in RICO that requires more "separateness" than that.

Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts his corporation's af-
fairs through illegal acts comes within § 1962(c)'s terms forbidding any
"person" unlawfully to conduct an "enterprise," particularly when RICO
explicitly defines "person" to include "any individual...  capable of hold-
ing a legal or beneficial interest in property," and defines "enterprise"
to include a "corporation,"  §§ 1961(3), (4).  And, linguistically speaking,
the employee and the corporation are different "persons,"  even where
the employee is the corporation's sole owner.  Incorporation's basic pur-
pose is to create a legal entity distinct from those natural individuals
who created the corporation, who own  it, or whom it employs.  See,
e. g.,  United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U. S.5 1, 61-62.  The precedent on
which the Second Circuit relied involved significantly different circum-
stances from those here at issue.  Further, to apply RICO in these cir-
cumstances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes of protecting
both a legitimate "enterprise" from those who would use unlawful acts
to victimize  it, United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 591,  and the
public from those who would unlawfully use an "enterprise" (whether
legitimate or illegitimate) as a "vehicle" through which unlawful activity
is committed, National Organizationf or Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510
U. S.2 49, 259.  Conversely, the appellate court's  critical legal distinc-
tion-between employees acting within and without the scope of corpo-
rate authority-would immunize from RICO liability many of those at
whom this Court has said RICO directly aims, e. g.,  high-ranking indi-
viduals in an illegitimate criminal enterprise, who, seeking to further
the  enterprise's  purposes,  act  within  the  scope  of their  authority,
cf. Turkette, supra,a t 581.  Finally, nothing in the statute's history sig-
nificantly favors an alternative interpretation.  This Court's rule is no
less consistent than is the lower court's rule with the following princi-
ples cited by King: (1) the principle that a corporation acts only through
its directors, officers, and agents;  (2) the principle that a corporation
should not be liable  for its employees'  criminal acts where Congress
so intends; and (3)  antitrust law's  intracorporate  conspiracy doctrine.

JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Racketeer  Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  Act
(RICO  or, Act),  18  U. S. C. § 1961 et seq., makes  it  "unlaw-
ful  for  any  person  employed  by  or  associated  with  any
enterprise..,  to conduct or participate...  in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs" through the commission of two or
more  statutorily defined crimes-which  RICO  calls "a pat-
tern  of  racketeering  activity."  § 1962(c).  The  language
suggests,  and  lower  courts  have  held,  that this  provision
foresees  two  separate  entities,  a  "person"  and  a  distinct
"enterprise."
This case focuses upon a person who is the president  and
sole shareholder of a closely held corporation.  The plaintiff
claims  that  the  president  has  conducted  the corporation's
affairs through the forbidden "pattern," though for present
purposes it is conceded that, in doing so, he acted within the
scope  of his  authority  as  the  corporation's  employee.  In
these circumstances,  are there two entities, a "person" and
a separate "enterprise"?  Assuming, as we must given the
posture of this case, that the allegations in the complaint are
true, we conclude  that the  "person" and  "enterprise" here
are distinct and that the RICO provision applies.
Petitioner, Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., is a corpora-
tion  that  promotes  boxing matches.  Petitioner  sued  Don
King, the president  and sole shareholder  of Don  King Pro-
ductions,  a  corporation,  claiming  that King  had  conducted
the boxing-related  affairs of Don  King Productions  in part
through a RICO "pattern," i. e., through the alleged commis-
sion of at least two instances of fraud and other RICO predi-

cate  crimes.  The  District Court,  citing Court  of Appeals
precedent, dismissed the complaint.  Civ. No. 98-6859, 1999
WL 771366, *3-4 (SDNY, Sept. 28, 1999).  And the Court of
Appeals  affirmed that dismissal.  219 F. 3d  115 (CA2 2000)
(per curiam).  In the appellate court's view, § 1962(c) applies
only  where a plaintiff shows the existence  of two separate
entities, a "person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of
which  that "person" improperly conducts.  Id.,  at 116.  In
this instance, "it is undisputed that King was  an employee"
of the corporation  Don  King Productions  and  also "acting
within the scope of his authority."  Id., at 117.  Under the
Court of Appeals'  analysis, King, in a legal sense, was part
of, not separate from, the corporation.  There was no "per-
son,"  distinct from  the "enterprise,"  who  improperly  con-
ducted the "enterprise's affairs."  And thus § 1962(c)  did not
apply.  Ibid.
Other  Circuits, applying  § 1962(c)  in roughly  similar cir-
cumstances,  have reached  a contrary conclusion.  See, e. g.,
Brannon v. Boatmen's First Nat. Bank of Okla., 153 F. 3d
1144,1148, n. 4 (CA10 1998); Richmond v. Nationwide Cassel
L. P., 52 F. 3d 640, 647 (CA7 1995); JaguarC  ars, Inc. v. Royal
Oaks Motor Car Co., 46 F. 3d 258, 265, 269 (CA3 1995); Sever
v. Alaska Pulp Corp., 978 F. 2d 1529, 1534 (CA9 1992).  We
granted  certiorari  to  resolve  the conflict.  We  now  agree
with these Circuits and hold that the Second Circuit's inter-
pretation of § 1962(c) is erroneous.
We do not quarrel with the basic principle that to establish
liability under § 1962(c) one must allege and prove the exist-
ence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2) an "enter-
prise" that is not simply the same "person" referred  to by
a different name.  The statute's language, read as ordinary
English,  suggests  that  principle.  The  Act  says  that  it
applies to  "person[s]"  who are  "employed  by  or associated
with" the "enterprise."  § 1962(c).  In ordinary English one
speaks of employing, being employed by, or associating with
others, not oneself.  See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 132 (1993) (defining "associate"); id., at 743 (defin-

Opinion of the Court
ing "employ").  In addition, the Act's purposes are consist-
ent with that principle.  Whether the Act seeks to prevent
a  person  from  victimizing, say, a  small  business,  S.  Rep.
No. 91-617, p. 77 (1969),  or to prevent a person from using a
corporation  for  criminal  purposes,  National Organization
for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 259 (1994),  the
person and the victim, or the person and the tool, are differ-
ent entities, not the same.
The Government reads § 1962(c) "to require some distinct-
ness  between  the  RICO  defendant  and  the  RICO  enter-
prise."  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11.  And
it says  that  this  requirement  is  "legally  sound  and  work-
able."  Ibid.  We  agree  with  its  assessment,  particularly
in light of the  fact that  12  Courts of Appeals have  inter-
preted the statute as embodying some such distinctness re-
quirement without  creating  discernible  mischief in the  ad-
ministration  of RICO.  See  St.  Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v.
Williamson, 224 F. 3d 425, 445 (CA5 2000);  United States v.
Goldin Industries, Inc., 219  F. 3d  1268,  1270  (CAll) (en

denied, 531 U. S. 1050 (2001).  Indeed, this Court previously
has said that liability "depends on showing that the defend-
ants conducted or participated in the conduct of the 'enter-
prise's affairs,' not just their own affairs."  Reves v. Ernst &
Young, 507 U. S. 170, 185 (1993).
While accepting  the "distinctness" principle, we nonethe-
less disagree  with  the  appellate  court's  application  of that
principle  to  the  present  circumstances-circumstances  in
which  a  corporate  employee,  "acting  within  the  scope  of
his authority," 219 F. 3d, at 117, allegedly conducts  the cor-
poration's affairs  in a RICO-forbidden  way.  The corporate
owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corpo-
ration itself, a legally different entity with different  rights
and  responsibilities  due  to  its different  legal  status.  And
we can find nothing in the statute that requires more "sepa-
rateness" than that.  Cf. McCullough v. Suter, 757 F. 2d 142,
144 (CA7 1985) (finding either formal or practical  separate-
ness sufficient to be distinct under § 1962(c)).
Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts the af-
fairs of a corporation  through illegal acts comes within the
terms  of a statute that forbids  any  "person" unlawfully  to
conduct  an "enterprise,"  particularly when the  statute  ex-
plicitly defines "person" to include "any individual...  capa-
ble of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property," and
defines "enterprise" to include a "corporation."  18 U. S. C.
§§ 1961(3),  (4).  And, linguistically  speaking, the employee
and the corporation are different "persons," even where the
employee is the corporation's sole owner.  After all, incorpo-
ration's basic purpose is to create a distinct legal entity, with
legal  rights,  obligations,  powers,  and  privileges  different
from those of the natural individuals who created it, who own
it, or whom it employs.  See United States v. Bestfoods, 524
U. S.  51,  61-62  (1998);  Burnet v.  Clark, 287  U. S.  410, 415
(1932);  1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Cor-
porations  §§ 7, 14 (rev. ed. 1999).

164  CEDRIC KUSHNER  PROMOTIONS,  LTD. v. KING
Opinion of the Court
We note that the Second  Circuit relied on earlier Circuit
precedent  for  its  decision.  But  that  precedent  involved
quite different  circumstances which are not presented here.
This case concerns a claim that a corporate  employee is the
"person" and the corporation is the "enterprise."  It is natu-
ral to speak of a corporate employee  as a "person employed
by" the corporation.  § 1962(c).  The earlier Second Circuit
precedent concerned a claim that a corporation was the "per-
son" and the corporation, together with all its employees and
agents, were the "enterprise."  See Riverwoods Chappaqua
Corp. v. Marine Midland Bank, N. A.,  30 F. 3d  339,  344
(1994)  (affirming dismissal of complaint).  It is less natural
to  speak  of a  corporation  as "employed  by" or  "associated
with" this latter oddly constructed entity.  And the Second
Circuit's other precedent also involved significantly different
allegations  compared  with the  instant case.  See Anatian
v. Coutts Bank  (Switzerland) Ltd.,  193  F. 3d 85, 89 (1999)
(affirming dismissal where plaintiff alleged  that same  bank
was both "person" and "enterprise"), cert. denied, 528 U. S.
1188  (2000);  Discon, Inc. v. NYNEX  Corp., 93  F. 3d  1055,
1064 (1996) (involving complaint alleging that corporate sub-
sidiaries were "persons" and subsidiaries, taken together as
parent,  were  "enterprise"), vacated  on  other grounds,  525
U. S.  128  (1998);  Bennett, supra, at 315, and n. 2 (same as
Anatian).  We  do  not  here  consider  the  merits  of these
cases, and note only their distinction  from the instant case.
Further, to  apply  the  RICO  statute  in  present  circum-
stances is consistent with the statute's basic purposes as this
Court  has  defined  them.  The  Court  has  held  that  RICO
both  protects  a  legitimate  "enterprise"  from  those  who
would use unlawful acts to victimize it, United States v. Tur-
kette, 452 U. S.  576, 591 (1981),  and also protects the public
from  those  who  would  unlawfully  use  an  "enterprise"
(whether legitimate  or illegitimate)  as  a "vehicle"  through
which  "unlawful  . . . activity  is  committed,"  National
Organizationf or Women, Inc., supra, at 259.  A corporate

Opinion of the Court
employee who conducts the corporation's  affairs through an
unlawful RICO "pattern...  of activity,"  § 1962(c), uses that
corporation  as a "vehicle" whether  he is, or is not, its sole
owner.
Conversely, the appellate court's critical legal distinction-
between employees acting within the scope of corporate  au-
thority and those acting outside that authority-is inconsist-
ent with a basic statutory purpose.  Cf. Reves, supra, at 184
(stating that an enterprise  is "'operated,'"  within § 1962(c)'s
meaning, "not just by upper management but also by lower
rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direc-
tion of upper management" (emphasis  added)).  It  would
immunize  from RICO liability many of those  at whom this
Court has said RICO directly aims-e. g., high-ranking indi-
viduals  in an illegitimate  criminal  enterprise, who, seeking
to further  the purposes  of that  enterprise, act  within  the
scope of their authority.  Cf. Turkette, supra, at 581  (Con-
gress "did nothing to indicate that an enterprise  consisting
of a  group of individuals  was not covered  by  RICO if the
purpose of the enterprise was exclusively criminal").
Finally, we have found nothing in the statute's history that
significantly favors an alternative interpretation.  That his-
tory not only refers frequently to the importance  of under-
mining  organized  crime's  influence  upon  legitimate  busi-
nesses but also refers to the need to protect the public from
those who would run "organization[s]  in a manner detrimen-
tal to the public interest."  S. Rep. No. 91-617, at 82.  This
latter purpose, as we have said, invites the legal principle we
endorse, namely, that in present  circumstances  the statute
requires no more  than the formal legal distinction  between
"person"  and  "enterprise"  (namely, incorporation)  that  is
present here.
In reply, King argues that the lower court's rule is consist-
ent  with  (1)  the  principle  that  a  corporation  acts  only
through its directors, officers, and agents, 1 Fletcher, supra,
§ 30, (2) the principle that a corporation should not be liable

166  CEDRIC  KUSHNER  PROMOTIONS,  LTD. v. KING
Opinion of the Court
for the criminal acts of its employees where Congress so in-
tends, Brief for Respondents 20-21, and (3) the Sherman Act
principle limiting liability under 15  U. S. C. § 1 by excluding
"from  unlawful  combinations  or conspiracies  the activities
of a  single  firm,"  Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube
Corp., 467 U. S. 752,  769-770, n. 15  (1984).  The alternative
that we endorse, however, is no  less consistent  with these
principles.  It does not deny that a corporation acts through
its employees;  it says only that the corporation  and its em-
ployees  are  not  legally  identical.  It  does  not  assert that
ordinary respondeat superior principles make a corporation
legally liable under RICO for the criminal acts of its employ-
ees; that is a matter of congressional intent not before  us.
See, e. g.,  Gasoline Sales, Inc., 39 F. 3d, at 73 (holding that
corporation cannot be "vicariously liable" for § 1962(c) viola-
tions committed by its vice president).  Neither is it incon-
sistent  with antitrust  law's  intracorporate  conspiracy  doc-
trine;  that  doctrine  turns  on  specific  antitrust  objectives.
See Copperweld Corp., supra, at 770-771.  Rather, we hold
simply  that  the need  for two  distinct  entities  is  satisfied;
hence, the RICO provision before us applies when a corpo-
rate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corpora-
tion  of which  he  is  the  sole  owner-whether  he  conducts
those affairs within the scope, or beyond the scope, of corpo-
rate authority.
For these reasons, the Court of Appeals' judgment is re-
versed,  and  the case  is remanded  for  further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
