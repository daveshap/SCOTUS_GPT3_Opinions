WASHINGTON  REDSKINS,  ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 95-388.  Argued March 27, 1996-Decided June 20, 1996
After their collective-bargaining agreement expired, the National Football
League (NFL), a group of football clubs, and the NFL Players Associa-
tion, a labor union, began to negotiate a new contract.  The NFL pre-
sented a plan that would permit each club to establish a "developmental
squad" of substitute  players, each of whom would  be paid the same
$1,000  weekly  salary.  The union disagreed, insisting that individual
squad members should be free to negotiate their own salaries.  When
negotiations reached an impasse, the NFL unilaterally implemented the
plan.  A number of squad players brought this antitrust suit, claiming
that the employers' agreement to pay them $1,000 per week restrained
trade in  violation of the Sherman Act.  The District  Court entered
judgment for the players on a jury treble-damages award, but the Court
of Appeals reversed, holding that the owners were immune from anti-
trust liability under the federal labor laws.
Held  Federal labor laws shield from antitrust attack an agreement among
several employers bargaining together to implement after impasse the
terms of their last best good-faith wage offer.  Pp. 235-250.
(a) This Court has previously found in the labor laws  an implicit,
"nonstatutory" antitrust exemption that applies where needed to make
the collective-bargaining process work.  See, e. g., Connell Constr. Co.
v. Plumbers,4 21 U. S. 616, 622.  The practice here at issue-the postim-
passe imposition of a proposed employment term concerning a manda-
tory subject of bargaining-is unobjectionable as a matter of labor law
and policy, and, indeed, plays a significant role in the multiemployer
collective-bargaining process that itself comprises an important part of
the Nation's industrial relations system.  Subjecting it to antitrust law
would  threaten  to  introduce  instability  and  uncertainty  into  the
collective-bargaining process, for antitrust often forbids or discourages
the kinds of joint discussions and behavior that collective bargaining
invites or requires.  Moreover, if antitrust courts tried to evaluate par-
ticular kinds of employer understandings, there would be created a web
of detailed rules spun by many different nonexpert antitrust judges and
juries, not a set of labor rules enforced by a single expert body, the

Syllabus
National Labor Relations Board, to which the labor laws give primary
responsibility  for  policing  collective  bargaining.  Thus,  the  implicit
exemption applies in this case.  Pp. 235-242.
(b) Petitioners'  claim  that  the  exemption  applies  only  to  labor-
management  agreements is  rejected, since  it is based on inapposite
authority, and an exemption limited by petitioners' labor-management-
consent principle could not work.  Pp. 243-244.
(c) Also rejected is the Government's  argument that the exemption
should terminate at the point of impasse.  Its rationale, that employers
are thereafter free as a matter of labor law to negotiate individual ar-
rangements on an interim basis with the union, is not completely accu-
rate.  More importantly, the simple "impasse" line would not solve the
basic problem that labor law permits employers, after impasse, to en-
gage in considerable joint behavior, while uniform employer conduct-
at  least when  accompanied  by  discussion-invites  antitrust  attack.
Pp. 244-247.
(d) Petitioners' alternative rule, which would exempt from antitrust's
reach postimpasse agreements about bargaining "tactics," but not those
about substantive "terms," is unsatisfactory because it would require
antitrust courts, insulated from the bargaining process, to delve into the
amorphous subject of employers' subjective motives in order to deter-
mine whether the exemption applied.  Pp. 247-248.
(e) Petitioners'  arguments relating to general  "backdrop"  statutes
and  the  "special"  nature  of professional  sports  are  also  rejected.
Pp. 248-250.
(f) The antitrust exemption applies to the employer conduct at issue
here,  which  took  place  during  and  immediately  after  a  collective-
bargaining negotiation; grew out of, and was a directly related to, the
lawful operation of the bargaining process; involved a matter that the
parties were required to negotiate collectively; and concerned only the
parties to the collective-bargaining relationship.  The Court's holding is
not intended to insulate from antitrust review every joint imposition of
terms by employers, for an employer agreement could be sufficiently
distant in time and in circumstances from the bargaining process that a
rule permitting antitrust intervention would not significantly interfere
with that process.  The, Court need not decide in this ease whether, or
where, to draw the line, particularly since it does not have the detailed
views of the Board on the matter.  P. 250.

BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.
Opinion of the Court
football players  brought this antitrust suit against football
club owners.  The club owners had bargained with the play-
ers'  union  over a  wage  issue  until they reached  impasse.
The owners then had agreed among themselves (but not with
the union)  to implement  the terms  of their own last best
bargaining offer.  The question before us is whether federal
labor laws shield  such an agreement from  antitrust attack.
We believe that they do.  This Court has previously found
in the labor laws an implicit antitrust exemption that applies
where  needed  to  make  the  collective-bargaining  process
work.  Like  the  Court  of Appeals,  we  conclude  that this
need makes the exemption applicable in this case.
We  can  state  the  relevant  facts  briefly.  In  1987,  a
collective-bargaining agreement between the National Foot-
ball League (NFL or League), a group of football clubs, and
the NFL Players Association,  a labor union, expired.  The
NFL and the Players Association began to negotiate a new
contract.  In March 1989, during the negotiations, the NFL
adopted Resolution G-2, a plan that would permit each club
to establish a "developmental squad" of up to six rookie or
"first-year" players who, as free agents, had failed to secure
a position on a regular player roster.  See App. 42.  Squad
members  would  play in practice  games and  sometimes  in
regular games as  substitutes for injured players.  Resolu-
tion G-2 provided that the club owners would pay all squad
members the same weekly salary.
The next month, April, the NFL presented the develop-
mental  squad  plan  to the  Players  Association.  The NFL
proposed  a squad player  salary  of $1,000  per week.  The
Players  Association  disagreed.  It  insisted  that  the  club
owners give developmental  squad players benefits and pro-
tections similar to those provided regular players, and that
they leave individual squad members free to negotiate their
own salaries.

Opinion of the Court
Two months later, in June, negotiations on the issue of de-
velopmental squad salaries reached an impasse.  The NFL
then unilaterally implemented the developmental squad pro-
gram by distributing to the clubs  a  uniform  contract  that
embodied the terms of Resolution G-2  and the $1,000  pro-
posed weekly salary.  The League advised club owners that
paying developmental squad players more or less than $1,000
per week would  result in disciplinary  action, including the
loss of draft choices.
In May  1990,  235  developmental  squad players  brought
this antitrust suit against the League and its member clubs.
The players claimed that their employers' agreement to pay
them a $1,000 weekly salary violated the Sherman Act.  See
15 U. S. C. § 1 (forbidding agreements in restraint of trade).
The  Federal District Court denied  the employers'  claim  of
exemption from the antitrust laws; it permitted the case to
reach the jury; and it subsequently  entered judgment on a
jury treble-damages award that exceeded $30 million.  The
NFL and its member clubs appealed.
The  Court of Appeals  (by a  split 2-to-1  vote) reversed.
The majority interpreted the labor laws  as "waiv[ing] anti-
trust liability for restraints on competition imposed through
the collective-bargaining process,  so long as such restraints
operate primarily in a labor market characterized  by collec-
tive bargaining."  50 F. 3d 1041,  1056  (CADC 1995).  The
court held, consequently, that the club owners were immune
from  antitrust  liability.  We  granted  certiorari  to  review
that determination.  Although we do not interpret the ex-
emption as broadly as did the Appeals Court, we nonetheless
find the exemption applicable, and we affirm that court's im-
munity conclusion.
II
The immunity before us rests upon what this Court has
called the "nonstatutory" labor exemption from the antitrust
laws.  Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers, 421  U. S. 616, 622
(1975);  see also Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676

BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.
Opinion of the Court
(1965);  Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381  U. S.  657 (1965).
The  Court  has implied  this  exemption  from  federal  labor
statutes, which set forth a national labor policy favoring free
and private collective bargaining, see 29 U. S. C. § 151; Tedm-
sters v. Oliver, 858 U. S. 283, 295 (1959); which require good-
faith bargaining over wages, hours, and working conditions,
see 29 U. S. C. §§ 158(a)(5),  158(d); NLRB v. Wooster Div. of
Borg-Warner Corp., 356 U. S. 342, 348-349 (1958); and which
delegate  related  rulemaking  and  interpretive  authority  to
the National Labor Relations Board (Board), see 29'U. S. C.
§ 153; San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359
U. S. 236, 242-245 (1959).
This  implicit  exemption  reflects  both history  and  logic.
As a matter of history, Congress intended the labor statutes
(from which the Court has implied the exemption) in part to
adopt the views of dissenting Justices  in Duplex Printing
Press Co. v. Deering,2 54 U. S. 443 (1921), which Justices had
urged the  Court  to  interpret  broadly  a  different  explicit
"statutory" labor exemption that Congress earlier (in 1914)
had written directly into the antitrust laws.  Id., at 483-488
(Brandeis, J., joined by  Holmes and  Clarke, JJ., dissenting)
(interpreting § 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 738, 29 U. S. C.
§ 52); see also United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219, 230-
236 (1941)  (discussing congressional reaction to Duplex).  In
the 1930's, when it subsequently enacted the labor statutes,
Congress,  as in  1914, hoped to prevent judicial use of anti-
trust law to resolve labor disputes-a kind of dispute  nor-
mally inappropriate for antitrust law resolution.  See Jewel
Tea,  supra, at  700-709  (opinion  of  Goldberg,  J.);  Marine
Cooks v. PanamaS . S. Co., 362 U. S. 365, 370, n. 7 (1960); A.
Cox, Law and the National Labor Policy 3-8 (1960); cf. Du-
plex, supra, at 485 (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (explicit "statu-
tory" labor exemption reflected view that "Congress, not the
judges, was the body which should declare what public policy
in regard to the industrial struggle demands").  The implicit
("nonstatutory") exemption interprets the labor statutes in

Opinion of the Court
accordance with this intent, namely, as limiting an antitrust
court's authority to determine, in the area of industrial con-
flict, what is or is not a "reasonable"  practice.  It thereby
substitutes  legislative  and administrative  labor-related  de-
terminations for judicial antitrust-related  determinations as
to  the  appropriate  legAl  limits  of industrial  conflict.  See
Jewel Tea, supra, at 709-710.
As a matter of logic, it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to require groups of employers and employees to bargain to-
gether, but at the same time to forbid them to make among
themselves  or  with  each  other  any  of  the  competition-
restricting  agreements  potentially  necessary  to make  the
process work or its results mutually acceptable.  Thus, the
implicit exemption recognizes that, to give effect to federal
labor laws  and  policies  and  to  allow meaningful  collective
bargaining to take place, some restraints on"c ompetition im-
posed through the bargaining process must be shielded from
antitrust  sanctions.  See  Connell, supra, at  622  (federal
labor laws "goals" could "never" be achieved if ordinary anti-
competitive effects of collective bargaining were held to vio-
late the antitrust laws); Jewel Tea, sUpra, at 711  (national
labor law scheme would be "virtually destroyed" by the rou-
tine imposition  of antitrust penalties upon parties engaged
in collective bargaining); Pennington, supra, at 665 (implicit
exemption  necessary to harmonize  Sherman Act with "na-
tional policy  ...  of promoting 'the  peaceful  settlement  of
industrial disputes by subjecting labor-management contro-
versies to the mediatory influence  of negotiation'")  (quoting
Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB,  379 U.S. 203,
211 (1964)).
The  petitioners  and  their  supporters  concede,  as  they
must, the  legal  existence  of  the  exemption  we  have  de-
scribed.  They  also  concede  that, where  its application  is
necessary  to  make  the  statutorily  authorized  collective-
bargaining process work as Congress  intended, the exemp-
tion  must  apply  both  to  employers  and  to  employees.

v. Actors' Equity Assn., 451 U. S. 704, 717, n. 20 (1981)  (ex-
plicit "statutory" exemption applies only to "bona fide labor
organization[s]").  Nor  does  the  dissent  take  issue  with
these basic principles.  See post, at 253-254.  Consequently,
the question before us is one of determining the exemption's
scope: Does it apply to an agreement among several employ-
ers  bargaining  together  to  implement  after  impasse  the
terms of their last best good-faith wage offer?  We assume
that such  conduct, as practiced in this  case, is unobjection-
able as a matter of labor law and policy.  On that assump-
tion, we conclude that the exemption applies.
Labor law itself regulates  directly, and  considerably, the
kind of behavior here at issue-the postimpasse imposition
of a proposed employment term concerning a mandatory sub-
ject of bargaining.  Both the Board and the courts have held
that, after impasse, labor law permits employers unilaterally
to  implement  changes  in pre-existing  conditions,  but only
insofar as the new terms meet carefully circumscribed con-
ditions.  For example, the new terms must be "reasonably
comprehended" within the employer's preimpasse  proposals
(typically the last rejected proposals), lest by imposing more
or less favorable  terms, the employer unfairly undermined
the union's status.  Storer Communications, Inc., 294

The collective-bargaining  proceeding itself must be free of

any unfair labor practice,  such  as an  employer's  failure to
have bargained in good faith.  See Akron Novelty Mfg. Co.,
224  N. L. R. B.  998, 1002  (1976)  (where employer  has  not
bargained in good faith, it may not implement a term of em-
ployment);  1 P. Hardin, The Developing Labor Law 697 (3d
ed. 1992) (same).  These regulations reflect the fact that im-
passe and an accompanying implementation of proposals con-
stitute an integral part of the bargaining process.  See Bo-
nanno Linen Serv., Inc., 243 N. L. R. B. 1093,  1094  (1979)

Although the case law we have cited focuses upon bargain-
ing by a single employer, no one here has argued that labor
law does, or should, treat multiemployer  bargaining differ-
ently  in  this  respect.  Indeed,  Board  and  court  decisions
suggest  that the joint  implementation  of proposed  terms
after impasse is a familiar practice in the context of multiem-
ployer bargaining.  See, e. g., El Cerrito Mill & Lumber Co.,

Multiemployer bargaining itself is a well-established, im-
portant, pervasive method of collective bargaining, offering
advantages to both management  and labor.  See Appendix,
infra, p. 251  (multiemployer bargaining  accounts  for more
than 40% of major collective-bargaining  agreements, and is
used in such industries as construction, transportation, retail
trade, clothing manufacture, and real estate, as well as pro-
fessional sports); NLRB v.  Truck Drivers, 353  U. S.8 7, 95

gaining as "a vital factor in the effectuation  of the national

tive bargaining");  Charles D. Bonanno Linen Service, Inc.

opment  of  industry-wide  worker  benefits  programs  that
smaller employers could not otherwise afford, and by inhibit-
ing employer competition at the workers' expense); Brief for
Respondent  NLRB in Bonanno Linen, 0. T. 1981, No. 80-

Print 1964) (same); see also C. Bonnett, Employers' Associa-
tions in the United States: A Study of Typical Associations
(1922)  (history).  The  upshot is that  the practice  at issue
here plays a significant role in a collective-bargaining process
that itself constitutes  an important part of the Nation's in-
dustrial relations system.
In these circumstances, to subject the practice to antitrust
law is to require antitrust courts to answer a host of impor-
tant practical questions about how collective bargaining over

Opinion of the Court
wages,  hours,  and  working conditions  is  to  proceed-the
. 
very result that the implicit labor exemption seeks to avoid.
And it is to place in jeopardy some of the potentially benefi-
cial labor-related effects that multiemployer  bargaining can
achieve.  That is because unlike labor law, which sometimes
welcomes  anticompetitive  agreements  conducive  to  indus-
trial harmony, antitrust law forbids  all agreements  among
competitors  (such as  competing  employers) that unreason-
ably lessen competition among or between them in virtually
any  respect  whatsoever.  See,  e. g.,  Paramount Famous
Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U. S. 30 (1930) (agreement
to insert arbitration  provisions in motion picture licensing
contracts).  Antitrust law also sometimes permits judges or
juries to premise antitrust liability upon little more than uni-
form behavior  among  competitors,  preceded  by conversa-
tions implying that later uniformity might prove desirable,
see, e. g.,  United States v. General Motors Corp., 384  U. S.
127, 142-143  (1966);  United States v. Foley, 598 F. 2d 1323,
1331-1332 (CA4 1979), cert. denied, 444 U. S. 1043 (1980), or
accompanied by other conduct that in context suggests that
each competitor failed to make an independent decision, see,
e. g., American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S. 781,
809-810 (1946);  United States v. Masonite Corp., 316  U. S.
265, 275 (1942); Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306
U. S. 208, 226-227 (1939).  See generally 6 P. Areeda, Anti-
trust  Law  1416-1427  (1986);  Turner, The  Definition  of
Agreement Under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism
and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 655 (1962).
If the antitrust laws apply, what are employers to do once
impasse is reached?  If all impose terms similar to their last
joint  offer,  they invite  an  antitrust  action  premised  upon
identical behavior (along with prior or accompanying conver-
sations)  as  tending  to  show  a  common  understanding  or
agreement.  If any, or all, of them individually impose terms
that differ significantly from that offer, they invite an unfair

Opinion of the Court
labor  practice  charge.  Indeed,  how  can  employers  safely
discuss  their offers  together  even before  a bargaining  im-
passe occurs?  A preimpasse discussion about, say, the prac-
tical advantages  or disadvantages  of a particular  proposal
invites a later antitrust claim that they agreed  to limit the
kinds  of  action  each  would  later  take  should  an  impasse
occur.  The same  is true of postimpasse discussions  aimed
at renewed negotiations with the union.  Nor would adher-
ence to the terms of an expired collective-bargaining  agree-
ment eliminate a potentially plausible antitrust claim charg-
ing that they had "conspired"  or tacitly "agreed" to do  so,
particularly  if maintaining the status  quo were  not in the
immediate  economic  self-interest  of  some.  Cf. Interstate
Circuit,s upra, at 222-223; 6 Areeda, supra,  1425.  All this
is to say that to permit antitrust liability here threatens to
introduce  instability  and  uncertainty  into  the  collective-
bargaining process, for antitrust law often forbids or discour-
ages  the  kinds  of joint discussions  and  behavior  that  the
collective-bargaining process invites or requires.
We  do not see any obvious  answer to this problem.  We
recognize,  as  the  Government  suggests, that, in principle,
antitrust courts might themselves try to evaluate particular
kinds of employer understandings, finding them "reasonable"
(hence lawful) where justified by collective-bargaining neces-
sity.  But any such evaluation means a web of detailed rules
spun  by  many  different  nonexpert  antitrust  judges  and
juries, not a set of labor rules enforced  by a single  expert
administrative body, namely the Board.  The labor laws give
the Board, not  antitrust courts, primary responsibility  for
policing the collective-bargaining process.  And one of their
objectives  was  to take from  antitrust courts the authority
to determine, through application of the antitrust laws, what
is  socially  or  economically  desirable  collective-bargaining
policy.  See supra, at 236-237; see also Jewel Tea, 381 U. S.,
at 716-719 (opinion of Goldberg, J.).

Opinion of the Court
III
Both petitioners and their supporters advance several sug-
gestions for drawing the exemption boundary  line short of
this case.  We shall explain why we find them unsatisfactory.
A
Petitioners claim that the implicit exemption applies  only
to labor-management agreements-a limitation that they de-
duce from case law language, see, e. g., Connell, 421 U. S., at
622 (exemption for "some union-employer agreements") (em-
phasis added),  and from a proposed principle-that the ex-
emption  must  rest upon  labor-management  consent.  The
language,  however,  reflects  only  the  fact  that  the  cases
previously before  the Court involved  collective-bargaining
agreements,  see  id., at 619-620;  Pennington, 381  U. S., at
660;  Jewel Tea, supra, at 679-680;  the language  does  not
reflect the exemption's rationale, see 50 F. 3d, at 1050.
Nor do we see how an exemption limited by petitioners'
principle  of  labor-management  consent  could  work.  One
cannot  mean  the  principle  literally-that  the  exemption
applies  only  to  understandings  embodied  in  a  collective-
bargaining agreement-for the collective-bargaining process
may take place before the making of any agreement or after
an agreement has expired.  Yet a multiemployer bargaining
process itself necessarily involves many procedural and sub-
stantive understandings  among participating employers  as
well as with the union.  Petitioners cannot rescue their prin-
ciple by claiming that the exemption applies only insofar as
both labor and management consent to'those understandings.
Often labor will not (and should not) consent to certain com-
mon bargaining positions that employers intend to maintain.
Cf. Areeda  & Hovenkamp,  Antitrust  Law  229'd,  at 277
("[J]oint employer preparation and bargaining in the context
of a  formal  multi-employer  bargaining  unit  is  clearly  ex-
empt").  Similarly, labor need not consent to certain tactics
that this Court has approved  as part of the multiemployer

Opinion of the Court
bargaining process, such as unit-wide lockouts and the use of
temporary  replacements.  See  NLRB  v.  Brown, 380  U. S.
278, 284 (1965); Buffalo Linen, 353 U. S., at 97.
Petitioners  cannot save their consent  principle by weak-
ening it, as by requiring union consent  only to the multi-
employer bargaining process itself.  This general consent is
automatically  present  whenever  multiemployer  bargaining
takes place.  See Hi-Way Billboards, Inc., 206  N. L. R. B.
22 (1973) (multiemployer unit "based on consent" and "estab-
lished by an unequivocal agreement by the parties"), enf. de-
nied on  other grounds,  500  F. 2d  181  (CA5  1974);  Weyer-
haeuser Co.,  166  N. L.  R. B.  299,  299-300  (1967).  As  so
weakened,  the principle  cannot  help  decide  which related
practices are, or are not, subject to antitrust immunity.
B
The Government argues that the exemption should termi-
nate at the point of impasse.  After impasse, it says, "em-
ployers no longer have a duty under the labor laws to main-
tain the status quo,"  and "are free as a matter of labor law
to negotiate  individual  arrangements  on  an  interim  basis
with the union."  Brief for  United  States  et al. as Amici
Curiae 17.
Employers, however, are not completely free at impasse. to
act independently.  The multiemployer bargaining unit ordi-
narily remains intact; individual employers cannot withdraw.
Bonanno Linen, 454 U. S., at 410-413.  The duty to bargain
survives;  employers must stand ready to resume  collective
bargaining.  See,  e. g.,  Worldwide  Detective  Bureau, 296
N. L. R. B. 148,  155 (1989);  Hi-Way Billboards, Inc., supra,
at 23.  And individual employers can negotiate individual in-
terim agreements with the union only insofar as those agree-
ments are consistent with "the duty to abide by the results
of group bargaining."  Bonanno Linen, supra, at 416.  Re-
gardless, the absence  of a legal "duty"  to act jointly is not
determinative.  This Court has implied antitrust immunities

NEW PAGE

Cite as: 518 U. S. 231 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
that extend beyond statutorily required joint action to joint
action  that a  statute "expressly  or impliedly allows  or  as-
sumes  must  also be immune."  1 P. Areeda  & D. Turner,
Antitrust Law  224, p. 145 (1978); see, e. g., Gordon v. New
York Stock Exchange, Inc., 422 U. S. 659, 682-691 (1975) (im-
munizing application of joint rule that securities law permit-
ted, but did not require);  United States v. National Assn. of
Securities Dealers,I nc., 422 U. S. 694, 720-730 (1975) (same).
More  importantly, the  simple  "impasse"  line  would  not
solve  the basic problem  we have  described above.  Supra,
at 241-242.  Labor law permits employers, after impasse, to
engage in considerable joint behavior,  including joint lock-
outs  and  replacement  hiring.  See, e. g.,  Brown, supra, at
289 (hiring of temporary replacement workers after lockout
was "reasonably adapted to the achievement of a legitimate
end-preserving the integrity of the multiemployer bargain-
ing unit").  Indeed, as a general matter, labor law often lim-
its employers  to four  options  at impasse:  (1) maintain the
status quo, (2) implement their last offer, (3) lock out their
workers  (and either shut down  or hire temporary  replace-
ments),  or (4) negotiate  separate  interim  agreements with
the union.  See generally 1 Hardin, The Developing Labor
Law, at 516-520, 696-699.  'What  is to happen if the parties
cannot reach an interim agreement?  The other alternatives
are limited.  Uniform employer conduct is likely.  Uniform-
ity-at least when accompanied by discussion of the matter-
invites antitrust  attack.  And  such attack  would  ask anti-
trust courts to decide the lawfulness of activities intimately
related to the bargaining process.
The problem is aggravated by the fact that "impasse" is
often temporary, see Bonanno Linen, supra, at 412 (approv-
ing Board's view of impasse as "a recurring feature in the
bargaining process,  . . .'a temporary  deadlock or hiatus in
negotiations which in almost all cases  is eventually broken,
through either a change  of mind  or the application  of eco-
nomic force")  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted); W. Sim-

Bargaining 139-140 (2d ed. 1986); it may differ from bargain-
ing  only in degree,  see  1 Hardin,  supra, at 691-696;  Taft
Broadcasting Co., 163 N. L. R. B., at 478; it may be manipu-
lated by the parties for bargaining purposes, see Bonanno
Linen, supra, at 413, n. 8  (parties might, for strategic pur-
poses,  "precipitate  an  impasse");  and  it may  occur  several
times during the course of a single labor dispute, since the
bargaining  process  is  not  over  when  the  first  impasse  is
reached,  cf. J. Bartlett, Familiar Quotations  754:8 (16th  ed.
1992).  How  are  employers  to  discuss  future  bargaining
positions  during a temporary impasse?  Consider, too, the
adverse consequences that flow from failing to guess how an
antitrustc ourt would later draw the impasse line.  Employ-
ers who  erroneously  concluded  that impasse had not been
reached would risk antitrust liability were they collectively
to maintain the status quo, while employers who erroneously
concluded that impasse had occurred would risk unfair labor
practice charges for prematurely suspending multiemployer
negotiations.
The United States  responds with suggestions for soften-
ing an "impasse" rule by extending the exemption after im-
passe "for such time as would be reasonable  in the circum-
stances" for employers to consult with counsel, confirm that
impasse has occurred, and adjust their business operations,
Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae2 4; by reestab-
lishing the exemption  once there is a "resumption of good-
faith bargaining," id., at 18, n. 5; and by looking to antitrust
law's "rule of reason" to shield-"in some circumstances"--
such joint actions  as the unit-wide lockout or the concerted
maintenance of previously established joint benefit or retire-
ment  plans,  ibid.  But  even  as  so  modified,  the  impasse-
related rule creates an exemption that can evaporate in the
middle  of the  bargaining  process,  leaving  later  antitrust
courts free to second-guess the parties' bargaining decisions

Opinion of the Court
and  consequently  forcing  them to  choose  their  collective-
bargaining responses  in light of what they predict or fear
that antitrust courts, not labor law administrators, will even-
tually decide.  Cf. Dallas General Drivers, Warehousemen
and Helpers, Local Union No. 745 v. NLRB, 355 F. 2d 842,
844-845 (CADC 1966) ("The problem of deciding when fur-
ther bargaining...  is futile is often difficult for the bargain-
ers and is necessarily so for the Board.  But in the whole
complex of industrial relations few issues are less suited to
appellate judicial appraisal..,  or better suited to the expert
experience  of  a  board  which  deals  constantly  with  such
problems").
C
Petitioners  and their supporters argue in the alternative
for a rule that would exempt postimpasse agreement about
bargaining  "tactics,"  but not postimpasse  agreement about
substantive "terms," from the reach of antitrust.  See 50 F.
3d,  at  1066-1069  (Wald,  J.,  dissenting).  They  recognize,
however, that both the Board and the courts have said that
employers  can,  and  often  do,  employ  the  imposition  of
"terms" as a bargaining "tactic."  See, e. g., American Ship
Building Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300, 316 (1965);  Colorado-
Ute Elec. Assn., Inc. v. NLRB, 939 F. 2d 1392, 1404 (CA10
1991),  cert. denied, 504 U. S. 955 (1992);  Circuit-Wise, Inc.,
309  N. L.  R. B.  905,  921  (1992);  Hi-Way Billboards, 206
N. L. R. B., at 23; Bonanno Linen, 243 N. L. R. B., at 1094.
This concession as to joint "tactical" implementation would
turn the presence of an antitrust exemption upon a determi-
nation of the employers'  primary purpose  or motive.  See,
e. g., 50 F. 3d, at 1069 (Wald, J., dissenting).  But to ask anti-
trust  courts, insulated  from the bargaining process,  to in-
vestigate  an  employer  group's subjective  motive  is to  ask
them to conduct an inquiry often more amorphous than those
we have  previously  discussed.  And, in our view, a  labor/
antitrust line  drawn  on such a basis would  too often raise

the  same  related  (previously  discussed)  problems.  See
supra, at 237, 241-242; Jewel Tea, 381 U. S., at 716 (opinion
of Goldberg, J.)  (expressing concern  about antitrust judges
"roaming at large" through the bargaining process).
D
Petitioners  make several  other arguments.  They point,
for  example,  to  cases  holding  applicable,  in  collective-
bargaining  contexts,  general  "backdrop"  statutes,  such  as
a state statute requiring a plant-closing employer to make
employee  severance  payments,  Fort Halifax Packing Co.
v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1 (1987),  and  a state statute mandating
certain  minimum  health  benefits,  Metropolitan Life  Ins.
Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985).  Those statutes,
however,  "'neither  encourage[d]  nor  discourage[d]  the
collective-bargaining  processes  that are  the subject  of the
[federal  labor laws]."'  Fort Halifax, supra, at 21  (quoting
Metropolitan Life, supra, at 755).  Neither  did those stat-
utes come accompanied with antitrust's labor-related history.
Cf. Oliver, 358 U. S., at 295-297 (state antitrust law inter-
feres  with  collective  bargaining  and  is  not  applicable  to
labor-management agreement).
Petitioners also say that irrespective of how the labor ex-
emption  applies  elsewhere to multiemployer  collective  bar-
gaining, professional sports is "special."  We can understand
how professional sports may be special in terms of, say, in-
terest, excitement, or concern.  But we do not understand
how  they  are  special  in  respect  to  labor  law's  antitrust
exemption.  We concede that the clubs that make up a pro-
fessional sports league are not completely independent eco-
nomic competitors, as they depend upon a degree of coopera-
tion  for  economic  survival.  National Collegiate Athletic
Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468  U. S. 85,
101-102  (1984);  App. 110-115  (declaration of NFL Commis-
sioner).  In the present context, however, that circumstance

Opinion of the Court
makes the league  more  like a single bargaining employer,
which analogy seems irrelevant to the legal issue before us.
We  also concede  that football players  often have special
individual talents, and, unlike many unionized workers, they
often negotiate their pay individually with their employers.
See post, at 255 (STEVENS, J.,  dissenting).  But this charac-
teristic seems  simply  a feature,  like so  many others,  that
might give employees (or employers) more (or less) bargain-
ing power, that might lead some (or all) of them to favor a
particular kind of bargaining, or that might lead to certain
demands  at the  bargaining  table.  We  do  not  see  how  it
could make a critical legal difference in determining the un-
derlying framework in  which  bargaining  is  to take  place.
See generally Jacobs & Winter, Antitrust Principles and Col-
lective Bargaining by Athletes: Of Superstars in Peonage, 81
Yale L. J. 1 (1971).  Indeed, it would be odd to fashion an"
antitrust exemption that gave additional advantages to pro-
fessional  football players  (by virtue of their  superior bar-
gaining power) that transport workers, coal miners, or meat
packers would not'enjoy.
The dissent points to other "unique features" of the par-
ties' collective-bargaining relationship, which, in the dissent's
view, make the case "atypical."  Post, at 255.  It says, for
example, that the employers  imposed the restraint  simply
to enforce compliance  with league-wide rules, and that the
bargaining consisted of nothing more than the sending of a
"notice," and therefore amounted only to "so-called" bargain-
ing.  Post, at 256-257.  Insofar  as these features underlie
an 'argument for looking to the employers' true purpose, we
have already discussed them.  See supra, at 247-248.  Inso-
far as they suggest that there was not a genuine impasse,
they  fight  the  basic  assumption  upon  which  the  District
Court, the Court of Appeals, petitioners, and this Court rest
the case.  See  782 F. Supp.  125,  134 (DC  1991);  50 F. 3d,
at 1056-1057; Pet. for Cert. i.  Ultimately, we cannot find a
satisfactory  basis  for  distinguishing  football  players  from

NEW PAGE

BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.
Opinion of the Court
other  organized  workers.  We  therefore  conclude  that all
must abide by the same legal rules.
For these reasons,  we hold that the implicit  ("nonstatu-
tory") antitrust exemption applies  to the employer conduct
at issue here.  That conduct took place during and immedi-
ately after a collective-bargaining negotiation.  It grew out
of, and was directly related to, the lawful  operation  of the
bargaining process.  It involved a matter  that the parties
were required  to negotiate  collectively.  And it concerned
only the parties to the collective-bargaining  relationship.
Our  holding  is  not  intended  to  insulate  from  antitrust
review every joint imposition of terms by employers, for an
agreement among employers  could be sufficiently distant in
time  and  in  circumstances  from  the  collective-bargaining
process that a rule permitting  antitrust intervention would
not significantly interfere with that process.  See, e. g., 50 F.
3d, at 1057 (suggesting that exemption lasts until collapse of
the collective-bargaining relationship, as evidenced by decer-
tification of the union); El Cerrito Mill & Lumber Co.,  316
N. L. R. B., at 1006-1007 (suggesting that "extremely long"
impasse,  accompanied  by  "instability"  or  "defunctness"  of
multiemployer  unit, might justify  union  withdrawal  from
group bargaining).  We need not decide in this case whether,
or where, within these extreme  outer boundaries  to draw
that line.  Nor would it be appropriate for us to do so with-
out the detailed views  of the Board, to whose  "specialized
judgment" Congress "intended to leave" many of the "inevi-
table questions concerning  multiemployer bargaining bound
to arise in the future."  Buffalo Linen, 353 U. S., at 96 (in-
ternal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  also  Jewel  Tea,  381
U. S., at 710, n. 18.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.

BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.
STEVENS, J., dissenting
JUSTICE STEVENS,  dissenting.
In his classic dissent in Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45,
75 (1905), Justice Holmes reminded us that our disagreement
with the economic theory embodied in legislation should not
affect our judgment about its constitutionality.  It is equally
important,  of course, to be faithful to the economic  theory
underlying broad statutory mandates when we are constru-
ing their impact on areas of the economy not specifically ad-
dressed by their texts.  The unique features of this case lead
me  to conclude  that the Court has  reached  a decision that
conflicts  with the basic purpose  of both the antitrust laws
and the national labor policy expressed in a series of congres-
sional enactments.
I
The basic premise underlying the Sherman Act is the as-
sumption that free competition among business  entities will
produce  the  best  price  levels.  National Soc.  of Profes-
sional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 695 (197.8).
Collusion  among  competitors,  it  is believed,  may produce
prices  that  harm  consumers.  United States  v.  Socony-
Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 226, n. 59 (1940).  Similarly,
the Court has held, a marketwide agreement among employ-
ers setting wages at levels that would not prevail in a free
market may  violate the Sherman Act.  Anderson v. Ship-
owners Assn. of Pacific Coast, 272 U. S. 359 (1926).
The jury's  verdict in  this  case has  determined  that the
marketwide agreement among these employers fixed the sal-
aries of the replacement players at a dramatically lower level
than would obtain in a free market.  While the special char-
acteristics of this industry may provide a justification for the
agreement under the rule of reason, see National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468
U. S. 85, 100-104  (1984), at this stage of the proceeding our
analysis of the exemption issue must accept the premise that
the agreement is unlawful unless it is exempt.

NEW PAGE

STEVENS, J., dissenting
The basic premise underlying our national labor policy is
that unregulated  competition  among employees  and  appli-
cants for employment produces  wage levels that are  lower
than they should be.'  Whether or not the premise is true
in fact, it is surely the basis for the statutes that encourage
and protect the collective-bargaining  process,  including the
express statutory exemptions from  the antitrust laws  that
Congress  enacted  in  order  to  protect  union  activities.2
Those  statutes were enacted to enable collective  action by
union members to achieve wage levels that are higher than
would be available in a free market.  See Trainmen v. Chi-
cago R. & L R. Co., 353 U. S. 30, 40 (1957).
The statutory labor exemption protects the right of work-
ers to act  collectively  to seek better wages, but does  not
I "The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not
possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and em-
ployers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership
association substantially burdens  and affects the flow of commerce,  and
tends to aggravate recurrent business  depressions, by depressing wage
rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by pre-
venting the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions
within and between industries."  29 U. S. C. § 151; R. Posner & F. Easter-
brook, Antitrust 31 (2d ed. 1981) ("The main purpose of labor unions is to
raise wages by suppressing competition among workers . . ."); see also
Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676, 723 (1965) (opinion of Gold-
berg, J.)  ("The very purpose and effect of a labor union is to limit the
power  of an employer to use  competition among workingmen  to  drive
down wage rates and enforce  substandard  conditions  of employment").
2,The basic sources of organized labor's exemption from federal  anti-
trust laws are  §§ 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731  and 738, 15
U. S. C. § 17 and 29 U. S. C. § 52, and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat.
70, 71, and 73,29 U. S. C. §§ 104, 105, and 113.  These statutes declare that
labor unions are not combinations or conspiracies  in restraint of trade,
and exempt specific  union activities, including secondary picketing  and
boycotts, from the operation of the antitrust laws.  See United States v.
Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219 (1941).  They do not exempt concerted action
or agreements between unions and nonlabor parties.  Mine Workers v.
Pennington,3 81 U. S. 657, 662 (1965)."  Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers,
421 U. S. 616, 621-622 (1975).

"exempt concerted action or agreements between unions and
nonlabor  parties."  Connell Constr. Co. v.  Plumbers, 421
U. S. 616,  621-622 (1975).  It is the judicially crafted, non-
statutory labor exemption  that serves  to  accommodate the
conflicting policies  of the antitrust and labor statutes in the
context of action between employers and unions.  Ibid.
The limited judicial exemption  complements its statutory
counterpart by ensuring that unions which engage in collec-
tive bargaining to enhance  employees' wages may enjoy the
benefits  of the resulting  agreements.  The purpose  of the
labor laws would be frustrated if it were illegal for employ-
ers to enter into industrywide agreements providing supra-
competitive wages for employees.  For that reason, we have
explained  that "a proper accommodation  between the con-
gressional  policy  favoring  collective  bargaining  under the
NLRA  and the congressional policy favoring free competi-
tion in business markets requires that some union-employer
agreements  be accorded  a  limited nonstatutory  exemption
from antitrust sanctions."  Id., at 622.
Consistent with basic labor law policies,  I agree with the
Court that the judicially crafted labor exemption must also
cover some collective action that employers take in response
to a collective-bargaining agent's demands for higher wages.
Immunizing such  action from antitrust scrutiny may facili-
tate collective bargaining over labor demands.  So, too, may
immunizing concerted  employer action designed to maintain
the integrity of the multiemployer  bargaining unit, such as
lockouts that are imposed in response to "a union strike tac-
tic which threatens the destruction of the employers' interest
in bargaining on a group basis."  NLRB v. Truck Drivers,
353 U. S. 87, 93 (1957).
In my view, however, neither the policies underlying the
two separate statutory schemes, nor the narrower focus on
the purpose of the nonstatutory exemption, provides a justi-
fication for exempting from antitrust scrutiny collective ac-
tion initiated by employers to depress wages below the level

that would be produced in a free market.  Nor do those poli-
cies support a rule that would allow employers to suppress
wages  by implementing noncompetitive  agreements  among
themselves  on  matters  that have  not previously been  the
subject of either an agreement with labor or even a demand
by labor for inclusion in the bargaining process.  That, how-
ever, is what is at stake in this litigation.
II
In light  of the accommodation  that has been  struck be-
tween antitrust and labor law policy, it would be most ironic
to  extend an  exemption crafted to protect collective action
by employees  to protect  employers  acting jointly  to  deny
employees  the opportunity to  negotiate  their salaries indi-
vidually  in  a  competitive  market.  Perhaps  aware  of the
irony, the  Court  chooses  to analyze  this case  as though it
represented a typical impasse in an unexceptional multiem-
ployer bargaining process.  In so doing, it glosses over three
unique features of the case that are  critical to  the inquiry
into whether the policies of the labor laws require extension
of the nonstatutory labor exemption to this atypical case.
First, in this market, unlike any  other area of labor law
implicated  in the cases  cited by the Court, player salaries
are individually negotiated.  The practice of individually ne-
gotiating player  salaries prevailed  even  prior to collective
bargaining  The  players  did not challenge  the prevailing
3As the District Court explained: "The present case does not involve
any change in preexisting wage terms of either an active or expired collec-
tive bargaining agreement.  In fact, creation of the developmental squads
added a novel category of players to each NFL club.  These players were
not treated under the salary terms applicable  to regular NFL players.
Under the 1982 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the NFL players were
expressly given the right to negotiate the salary terms of their contracts.

the prospective  developmental  squad players had no right to negotiate
their own salary terms but instead were to receive a fixed non-negotiable

practice because, unlike employees in most industries, they
want their compensation to be  determined by the forces of
the free market rather than by the process of collective bar-
gaining.  Thus, although the majority professes an inability
to  understand  anything  special  about  professional  sports
that should affect the framework of labor negotiations, ante,
at 248-249, in this business it is the employers, not the em-
ployees, who seek to impose a noncompetitive uniform wage
on a segment of the market and to put an end to competitive
wage negotiations.
Second, respondents  concede that the employers imposed
the wage  restraint to force owners  to comply with league-
wide rules that limit the number of players that may serve
on a team, not to facilitate a stalled bargaining  process, or
to  revisit  any  issue  previously  subjected  to  bargaining.
Brief for  Respondents  4. The employers  could  have  con-
fronted the culprits directly by stepping up enforcement  of
roster limits.  They instead chose to address the problem by
unilaterally preventing players from individually competing
in the labor market.
Third, although the majority asserts that the "club owners
had bargained with the players' union over a wage issue until
they reached impasse," ante, at 234, that hardly constitutes a
complete description of what transpired.  When the employ-
ers' representative advised the union that they proposed to
pay the players a uniform wage determined by the owners,
the union promptly and unequivocally  responded that their
proposal was inconsistent with the "principle"  of individual
salary negotiation  that had been  accepted  in the past and
that  predated  collective  bargaining.4  The  so-called  "bar-
salary of $1,000 per week.  Plaintiffs'  Exhibits at 8,  9, 15 & 28."  782
F. Supp. 125, 138 (DC 1991).

tive, the owners representative stated, in part:
"Gene  [Upshaw] indicated he fully understood the developmental  squad
but could not agree to any arrangement that eliminated the right of any

gaining"  that followed amounted to nothing more than the
employers'  notice to the union that they had decided to im-
plement a decision to replace individual  salary negotiations
with a uniform  wage level for  a specific group  of players.5
Given  these features  of the  case, I  do not  see  why the
employers should be entitled to a judicially crafted  exemp-
tion from antitrust liability.  We have explained that "[t]he
nonstatutory  exemption  has its source in the strong labor
policy  favoring  the  association  of  employees  to  eliminate
competition  over wages and working conditions."  Connell
Constr. Co., 421 U. S., at 622.  I know of no similarly strong
labor policy that favors the association of employers to elimi-
nate  a competitive  method  of negotiating  wages  that pre-
dates  collective bargaining  and  that labor would  prefer  to
preserve.
Even if some collective action by employers may justify an
exemption because it is necessary to maintain the "integrity
of the multiemployer bargaining unit," NLRB v. Brown, 380
U. S. 278, 289 (1965),  no such justification exists here.  The
employers  imposed a fixed wage even though there was no
dispute  over the pre-existing principle  that player salaries
should be individually negotiated.  They sought only to pre-
vent certain owners from evading roster limits and thereby
gaining an unfair  advantage.  Because  "the  employer's in-
terest is  a competitive  interest rather than  an interest in
regulating its own labor  relations,"  Mine Workers v. Pen-
nington, 381 U. S. 657, 667 (1965), there would seem to be no
player to negotiate his individual  salary.  Upshaw said that no matter
what salary level we proposed to pay developmental players, whether it
was our $1,000 weekly or a higher number, the union would not 'in princi-
ple' permit two classes of players to exist, one with individual bargaining
rights and one without."  App. 19-20.
5 The unique features of this case presumably explain why the National
Labor Relations Board (Labor Board) can endorse the position of the play-
ers in this case without fearing the adverse impact on the bargaining proc-
ess in the hypothetical  cases that concern the Court.  Brief for United
States et al. as Amici Curiae 27, n. 10.

more reason to exempt this concerted,  anticompetitive  em-
ployer action  from the antitrust laws than the action  held
unlawful in Radovich v. National FootballL  eague, 352 U. S.
445 (1957).
The point of identifying the unique features of this case is
not, as the Court suggests, to make the case that professional
football players, alone among workers, should be entitled to
enforce the antitrust laws against anticompetitive collective
employer  action.  Ante, at 249.  Other  employees,  no less
than well-paid athletes, are entitled to the protections of the
antitrust laws when their employers unite to undertake anti-
competitive action that causes them direct harm and alters
the state of employer-employee  relations that existed prior
to unionization.  Here that alteration occurred because the
wage terms that the employers unilaterally imposed directly
conflict with a pre-existing principle  of agreement between
the  bargaining  parties.  In  other  contexts,  the  alteration
may take  other  similarly anticompetitive  and  unjustifiable
forms.
III
Although  exemptions  should be construed  narrowly, and
judicially crafted exemptions more narrowly still, the Court
provides  a sweeping justification for the exemption  that it
creates  today.  The consequence is a newly minted exemp-
tion that, as I shall explain, the Court crafts only by ignoring
the reasoning of one  of our prior decisions in favor of the
views of the dissenting Justice in that case.  Of course, the
Court actually holds only that this new exemption applies in
cases such as the present in which the parties to the bargain-
ing process  are affected  by the challenged  anticompetitive
conduct.  Ante, at 250.  But that welcome limitation on its
opinion fails to make the Court's explanation of its result in
this case any more persuasive.
The Court explains that the nonstatutory labor exemption
serves to ensure that "antitrust courts" will not end up sub-
stituting their views  of labor policy for those  of either the

STEVENS,  J., dissenting
Labor Board or the bargaining parties.  Ante, at 236-237.
The Court concludes,  therefore, that almost any  concerted
action by employers that touches on a mandatory subject of
collective bargaining, no matter how obviously  offensive to
the  policies  underlying  the  Nation's  antitrust  statutes,
should  be immune  from  scrutiny  so  long  as  a  collective-
bargaining process is in place.  It notes that a contrary con-
clusion would  require "antitrust courts, insulated from the
bargaining process,  to investigate  an employer group's sub-
jective motive,"  a task that it believes too "amorphous"  to
be permissible.  Ante, at 247.
The argument that "antitrust courts" should be kept out
of the collective-bargaining  process has a venerable lineage.
See Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S.  443,
483-488  (1921)  (Brandeis, J., joined by Holmes  and  Clarke,
JJ.,  dissenting).  Our  prior  precedents  subscribing  to  its
basic point, however, do not justify the conclusion that em-
ployees have no recourse other than the Labor Board when
employers collectively undertake anticompetitive action.  In
fact, they contradict it.
We have previously considered the scope of the nonstatu-
tory labor exemption  only in cases  involving challenges  to
anticompetitive agreements between unions and  employers
brought by other employers not parties to those agreements.
Ante, at 243.  Even then, we have concluded that the exemp-
tion does not always apply.  See Mine Workers v. Penning-
ton, 381 U. S., at 663.
As Pennington explained, the mere fact that an antitrust
challenge touches on an issue, such as wages, that is subject
to mandatory bargaining does not suffice to trigger the judi-
cially fashioned exemption.  Id., at 664.  Moreover, we con-
cluded that the exemption should not obtain in Pennington
itself only after we examined the motives of one of the par-
ties to the bargaining process.  Id., at 667.
The Court's only attempt to square its decision with Pen-
nington occurs at the close of its opinion.  It concludes that

NEW PAGE

BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.
STEVENS, J., dissenting
the exemption applies because  the employers'  action "grew
out of, and was  directly related to, the lawful  operation  of
the bargaining process," "[i]t involved a matter that the par-
ties were required to negotiate collectively,"  and that "con-
cerned only the parties to the collective-bargaining  relation-
ship."  Ante, at 250.
As to the first two qualifiers,  the same  could be said of
Pennington.  Indeed,  the  same  was  said  and rejected in
Pennington.  "This is not to say that an agreement result-
ing from  union-employer  negotiations  is  automatically  ex-
empt from Sherman Act scrutiny simply because the negotia-
tions involve a compulsory subject of bargaining, regardless
of the subject or the form  and content of the agreement."
381 U. S.,  at 664-665.
The final qualifier does  distinguish Pennington, but only
partially so.  To determine whether the exemption  applied
in  Pennington, we undertook  a  detailed  examination  into
whether the policies of labor law so strongly supported the
agreement struck by the bargaining parties that it  should be
immune from antitrust scrutiny.  We concluded that because
the agreement affected employers not parties to the bargain-
ing process,  labor law policies  could  not be understood  to
require the exemption.
Here, however, the Court does not undertake  a review of
labor law policy to determine whether it  would support an
exemption  for  the unilateral  imposition  of anticompetitive
wage terms  by employers  on a union.  The  Court appears
to conclude instead that the exemption should apply merely
because  the  employers'  action  was  implemented  during a
lawful negotiating process concerning  a mandatory  subject
of bargaining.  Thus,  the  Court's  analysis  would  seem to
constitute both an unprecedented  expansion  of a heretofore
limited  exemption,  and  an  unexplained  repudiation  of the
reasoning  in  a prior, nonconstitutional  decision  that  Con-
gress itself has not seen fit to override.

STEVENS, J., dissenting
The  Court nevertheless  contends  that the "rationale" of
our prior  cases  supports  its approach.  Ante,  at 243.  As
support for that contention,  it relies heavily on  the views
espoused in Justice Goldberg's separate opinion in Meat Cut-
ters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381  U. S. 676  (1965).  At five critical
junctures in its opinion, see ante, at 236, 237-238, 242, 247-
248, the Court invokes that separate concurrence  to explain
why, for purposes of applying the nonstatutory labor exemp-
tion, labor law policy admits of no distinction between collec-
tive employer action taken in response to labor demands and
collective employer action of the kind we consider here.
It should be remembered  that Jewel Tea concerned  only
the question whether an agreement between employers and
a union may be exempt, and that even then the Court did not
accept the broad antitrust exemption that Justice  Goldberg
advocated.  Instead, Justice White, the ailthor of Penning-
ton, writing for Chief Justice Warren  and Justice  Brennan,
explained that even in disputes over the lawfulness of agree-
ments about terms that are subject to mandatory bargaining,
courts  must  examine  the bargaining  process  to  determine
whether  antitrust scrutiny  should  obtain.  Jewel Tea, 381
U. S., at 688-697.  "The crucial determinant is not the form
of the  agreement-e. g.,  prices  or  wages-but  its relative
impact on  the product  market  and the interests of union
members."  Id., at 690, n. 5  (emphasis added).  Moreover,
the  three  dissenters,  Justices  Douglas,  Clark,  and  Black,
concluded that the union was entitled to no immunity at all.
Id., at 735-738.
It should also be remembered that Justice Goldberg used
his separate opinion in Jewel Tea to explain his reasons for
dissenting from the Court's opinion in Pennington.  He ex-
plained that the Court's approach in Pennington was unjus-
tifiable precisely because  it permitted "antitrust courts" to
reexamine  the bargaining  process.  The  Court fails to ex-
plain its apparent  substitution in this case of Justice  Gold-

BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.
STEVENS, J., dissenting
berg's  understanding  of the  exemption,  an  understanding
previously endorsed by only two other Justices, for the one
adopted by the Court in Pennington.
The Court's silence is all the more remarkable  in light of
the patent factual  distinctions  between Jewel Tea and  the
present  case.  It is not  at all  clear  that Justice  Goldberg
himself understood his expansive  rationale to require appli-
cation of the exemption in circumstances such as those before
us here.  Indeed, the main theme of his opinion was that the
antitrust laws  should not be used to circumscribe bargain-
ing over union demands.  Jewel Tea, 381  U. S.,  at 723-725.
Moreover, Justice Goldberg proved himself to be a most un-
reliable  advocate for the sweeping position  that the Court
attributes to him.
Not long after leaving the Court, Justice Goldberg served
as  counsel  for  Curt  Flood,  a  professional  baseball  player
who contended  that major  league baseball's  reserve  clause
violated the antitrust laws.  Flood v. Kuhn, 407  U. S.  258
(1972).  Although  the  Flood  case  primarily  concerned
whether professional baseball should be exempt from anti-
trust law  altogether, see  Federal Baseball Club of Balti-
more, Inc. v.  National League  of Professional Baseball
Clubs, 259  U. S. 200 (1922);  Toolson v. New  York  Yankees,
Inc., 346 U. S. 356  (1953),  the labor law  dimensions  of the
case did not go unnoticed.
The article that first advanced the expansive view of the
nonstatutory labor exemption that the Court appears now to
endorse was written shortly after this Court granted certio-
rari in Flood, see Jacobs & Winter, Antitrust Principles and
Collective Bargaining by Athletes: Of Superstars in Peonage,
81 Yale L. J. 1 (1971),  and the parties to the case addressed
the very questions now before us.  Aware of both this com-
mentary, and, of course, his own prior opinion in Jewel Tea,
Justice  Goldberg  explained  in his brief to this  Court why
baseball's reserve  clause should not be protected from anti-
trust review by the nonstatutory labor exemption.

"This Court has held that even a labor organization, the
principal intended beneficiary of the so-called labor ex-
emption, may not escape antitrust liability when it acts,
not unilaterally and in the sole interest of its own mem-
bers, but in concert with employers 'to  prescribe labor
standards outside the bargaining unit[.]'  And this is so
even when the issue is so central to bargaining as wages.
Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. at 668.  Com-
pare Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676 (1965).
See  Ramsey  v.  Mine  Workers,  401  U.S.  302,  307
(1971)....
"The separate opinion on which respondents focus did
express the view that 'collective bargaining activity on
mandatory  subjects of bargaining'  is exempt from anti-
trust regulation, without regard to whether the union
conduct involved is 'unilateral.'  Meat Cutters v. Jewel
Tea Co., 381 U. S. at 732 (concurring opinion).  But the
author  of that opinion  agreed  with the  majority  that
agreements  between  unions  and  nonlabor  groups  on
hard-core restraints like 'price-fixing and market alloca-
tion' were not exempt.  381 U. S. at 733.  And there is
no support in any of the opinions filed in Meat Cutters
for Baseball's essential, if tacit, contention that unilat-
eral,  hard-core  anticompetitive  activity  by  employers
acting  alone-the  present  case-is  somehow  exempt
from antitrust regulation."  Reply Brief for Petitioner
in Flood v. Kuhn, 0. T. 1971, No. 71-32, pp. 13-14.
Moreover, Justice  Goldberg explained  that the extension
of antitrust immunity to unilateral, anticompetitive employer
action would be particularly inappropriate because baseball's
reserve clause predated collective bargaining.
"This  case  is  in fact  much  clearer  than  Pennington,
Meat Cutters, or Ramsey, for petitioner does not chal-
lenge  the  fruits  of collective  bargaining  activity.  He
seeks relief from a scheme-the reserve system-which

STEVENS, J., dissenting
Baseball  admits  has  been  in  existence  for  nearly  a
century, and which  the trial court expressly found was
'created  and  imposed  by the  club  owners  long before
the arrival of collective bargaining."'  Id., at 14.
I would add only that this case is in fact much clearer than
Flood, for  there the  owners sought  only  to preserve a  re-
straint  on competition  to which the union had not  agreed,
while here they seek to create one.
Adoption  of  Justice  Goldberg's  views  would  mean,  of
course, that in some instances "antitrust courts" would have
to  displace  the  authority  of the  Labor  Board.  The labor
laws  do not  exist, however,  to ensure  the perpetuation  of
the Board's authority.  That is why we have not previously
adopted the Court's position.  That is also why in other con-
texts we have not thought the mere existence of a collective-
bargaining agreement sufficient to immunize employers from
background laws that are similar to the Sherman Act.  See
FortH  alifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1 (1987); Metro-
politan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts,4 71 U. S. 724 (1985).6
6 In Teamsters v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283 (1959), we held that a state anti-
trust law could not be used to challenge an employer-union agreement.
Justice White's opinion in Jewel Tea explains, however, that Oliver held
only that "[als  the agreement did not embody  a "'remote  and indirect
approach to the subject of wages" . . . but a direct frontal attack upon a
problem thought to threaten the maintenance of the basic wage structure
established by the collective bargaining contract,'  [358 U. S.1,  at 294, the
paramount federal policy of encouraging collective bargaining proscribed
application of the state law."  Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S., at 690, n. 5.
Moreover,  in  the petition for  certiorari  in  Flood, Justice  Goldberg
explained that Oliver was not controlling.
"Petitioner has not addressed the contention advanced by respondents
at trial but not reached by the courts below, that the reserve system is a
matter for collective bargaining and hence exempt from state and federal
antitrust laws under Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283 (1959), and
Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676 (1965).  Neither of these deci-
sions holds that an employer conspiracy to restrain trade is exempted from
antitrust regulation where an employee group has been implicated in the
scheme.  No  Justice participating in Meat Cutters dissented from the

Congress is free to act to exempt the anticompetitive em-
ployer conduct that we review today.  In the absence of such
action,  I do not believe  it is for us  to stretch  the limited
exemption that we have fashioned to facilitate the express
statutory exemption created for labor's benefit so that unions
must strike in order to restore a prior practice of individu-
ally negotiating  salaries.  I therefore agree with the posi-
tion that the District Court adopted below.
"Because the developmental  squad salary provisions
were  a new concept  and not a change in terms of the
expired  collective bargaining agreement, the policy be-
hind  continuing the  nonstatutory labor  exemption  for
the terms of a collective bargaining agreement after ex-
piration (to foster an atmosphere conducive to the nego-
tiation of a new collective bargaining agreement)  does
not apply.  To hold that the nonstatutory labor exemp-
tion extends to shield the NFL from antitrust liability
for imposing restraints never before  agreed to by the
union would not only infringe on the union's freedom to
contract, H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. at 108...
(one  of fundamental  policies  of NLRA  is  freedom  of
contract),  but would  also contradict  the very purpose
of the antitrust exemption by not promoting execution
of a collective bargaining  agreement with terms mutu-
proposition that hard core 'anticompetitive  commercial  restraint[s]'  like
'price-fixing and market allocation'-and petitioner would add group boy-
cotts-were subject to antitrust regulation even where bargained about.

in 1949, 'Benefits to organized labor cannot be utilized as a cat's paw to pull
employer's  chestnuts out of antitrust fires.'  United States v. Women's
Sportswear Mfr's Assn, 336 U. 5.460,464 (1949).  See also Allen Bradley
Co. v. Local No. 3, 325 U. S. [797] (1945).  Similar arguments by football
were rejected by this Court in Radovich [v. National Football League,

sports are now regulated by state and federal antitrust laws."  Pet. for
