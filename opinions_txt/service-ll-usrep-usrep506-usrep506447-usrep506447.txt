SPECTRUM  SPORTS,  INC., ET  AL.  v.  McQUILLAN
ET VIR,  DBA  SORBOTURF  ENTERPRISES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 91-10.  Argued November 10, 1992-Decided January 25, 1993
Shortly after the manufacturer of sorbothane-a patented elastic polymer
with shock-absorbing  characteristics-informed  respondents,  distribu-
tors of medical, athletic, and equestrian products made with sorbothane,
that it would  no longer sell  them the  polymer, petitioner  Spectrum
Sports, Inc., became the national distributor of sorbothane athletic prod-
ucts.  Respondents' business failed, and  they filed suit in the District
Court against petitioners and others, seeking damages for alleged viola-
tions of, inter alia, § 2 of the Sherman Act, which makes it an offense
for any person to "monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or
conspire ...  to monopolize any part of the trade  or commerce among
the several States."  A jury found that the defendants  violated §2 by,
in the words of the verdict sheet, "monopolizing, attempting to monopo-
lize, and/or conspiring to monopolize."  The Court of Appeals affirmed,
noting that, although the jury had not specified which of the three possi-
ble § 2 violations had occurred, the verdict stood because the evidence
established a case of attempted monopolization.  Relying on its earlier
rulings in Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F. 2d 459, and its progeny,
the court held that the jury could have inferred two of the elements of
that offense-a specific intent to achieve monopoly power and a danger-
ous probability of monopolization of a relevant market-from evidence
showing the defendants' unfair or predatory conduct, without any proof
of relevant market or the defendants' market power, and that the jury
was properly instructed that it could make such inferences.
Held: Petitioners  may not be  liable for attempted  monopolization under
§ 2 absent proof of a dangerous probability that they would monopolize
a relevant market and specific intent to monopolize.  The conduct of a
single firm, governed by § 2, is unlawful "only when it threatens actual
monopolization."  Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467
U. S. 752, 767.  Consistent with this approach, Courts of Appeals other
than the court below have generally required a plaintiff in an attempted
monopolization case to prove that (1) the defendant has engaged in pred-
atory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize
and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.  Unfair
or predatory conduct may be sufficient to prove the necessary intent to

Opinion of the Court
monopolize.  However, intent alone is insufficient to establish the dan-
gerous  probability of success, Swift & Co. v.  United States, 196 U. S.
375,  402,  which requires  inquiry  into  the relevant  product  and geo-
graphic  market  and  the defendant's  economic  power  in that market.
There  is little if any  support  in the statute or case law  for Lessig's
contrary  interpretation of §2.  Moreover, Lessig and its progeny are
inconsistent  with the Sherman Act's  purpose of protecting the  public
from the failure of the market.  The law directs itself only against con-
duct that unfairly tends to destroy competition, and, thus, courts have
been careful to avoid constructions of § 2 which might chill competition
rather than foster it.  The concern that § 2 might be applied so as to
further  anticompetitive  ends  is  plainly  not  met  by  inquiring  only
whether the defendant has engaged in "unfair" or "predatory" tactics.
Since the jury's instructions and the Court of Appeals' affirmance both
misconstrued § 2, and since the jury's verdict did not negate the possibil-
ity that it rested on the attempt to monopolize ground alone, the case is
remanded for further proceedings.  Pp. 454-460.
907 F. 2d 154, reversed and remanded.
WHITE, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
James  D.  Vail  argued  the  cause  and  filed  briefs  for
petitioners.
Robert A.  Long, Jr., argued  the  cause  for  the  United
States as amicus curiae in support of petitioners.  With him
on the brief were Solicitor General Starr, Acting Assistant
Attorney GeneralJ ames, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace,
and Catherine G. O'Sullivan.
Jeffrey  M.  Shohet  argued  the  cause  for  respondents.
With him on the brief was Marcelle E. Mihaila.
JUSTICE WHITE  delivered  the opinion of the Court.
Section 2 of the Sherman  Act, 26  Stat. 209, as amended,
15 U. S. C. § 2, makes it an offense for any person to "monopo-
lize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine  or conspire with
any other person  or persons, to monopolize any part of the
trade or  commerce  among  the several  States  . . . ."  The
jury in this case returned a verdict finding that petitioners
had monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired
to monopolize.  The District Court entered a judgment rul-

Opinion of the Court
ing that petitioners had  violated  § 2, and  the Court of Ap-
peals affirmed on the ground that petitioners had attempted
to monopolize.  The issue we have before us is whether the
District  Court and  the Court of Appeals  correctly  defined
the elements of that offense.
Sorbothane  is  a  patented  elastic  polymer  whose  shock-
absorbing characteristics make it useful in a variety of medi-
cal,  athletic,  and  equestrian  products.  BTR,  Inc.  (BTR),
owns the patent rights to sorbothane, and its wholly owned
subsidiaries  manufacture  the product  in  the United  States
and Britain.  Hamilton-Kent  Manufacturing  Company
(Hamilton-Kent) and Sorbothane, Inc. (S. I.), were at all rele-
vant times owned by BTR.  S. I. was formed in 1982 to take
over Hamilton-Kent's sorbothane business.'  App. to Pet. for
Cert. A3.  Respondents Shirley and Larry McQuillan, doing
business  as  Sorboturf Enterprises, were  regional distribu-
tors  of sorbothane  products from  1981  to  1983.  Petitioner
Spectrum Sports, Inc. (Spectrum), was also a distributor of
sorbothane  products.  Petitioner Kenneth  B. Leighton, Jr.,
is a co-owner of Spectrum.  Ibid.  Kenneth Leighton, Jr., is
the son of Kenneth Leighton, Sr., the president of Hamilton-
Kent and S. I. at all relevant times.
In 1980, respondents  Shirley and Larry McQuillan  signed
a letter of intent with Hamilton-Kent, which then owned all
manufacturing  and  distribution  rights to sorbothane.  The
letter of intent granted  the McQuillans  exclusive  rights to
purchase sorbothane foruse in equestrian products.  Respond-
ents were designing a horseshoe pad using sorbothane.
In  1981, Hamilton-Kent  decided  to establish five regional
distributorships for sorbothane.  Respondents were selected
to be distributors of all sorbothane products, including medi-
cal products and shoe inserts, in the Southwest.  Spectrum
I Sorbothane, Inc., was formerly called Sorbo, Inc.  App. 67.

Opinion of the Court
was  selected  as  distributor  for  another  region.  Id.,  at
A4-A5.
In January 1982, Hamilton-Kent shifted responsibility for
selling medical products from five regional distributors to a
single  national  distributor.  In  April  1982,  Hamilton-Kent
told respondents  that it wanted them to relinquish their ath-
letic  shoe  distributorship  as  a  condition  for  retaining  the
right to develop  and distribute  equestrian products.  As of
May  1982,  BTR  had  moved  the  sorbothane  business  from
Hamilton-Kent  to S. I.  Id., at A6.  In May, the marketing
manager  of S.  I.  again made clear that respondents  had to
sell  their  athletic  distributorship  to  keep  their equestrian
distribution  rights.  At a meeting scheduled to discuss  the
sale  of  respondents'  athletic  distributorship  to  petitioner
Leighton, Jr., Leighton, Jr., informed Shirley McQuillan  that
if she did  not come  to  agreement  with  him she  would  be
"'looking  for work."'  Id., at A6.  Respondents  refused  to
sell and continued to distribute athletic shoe inserts.
In  the fall  of  1982,  Leighton,  Sr.,  informed  respondents
that  another  concern  had  been  appointed  as  the  national
equestrian  distributor,  and  that  they  were  "no  longer in-
volved  in  equestrian  products."  Id.,  at  A7.  In  January
1983, S.  I. began marketing through a national distributor a
sorbothane  horseshoe  pad  allegedly  indistinguishable  from
the  one  designed  by  respondents.  Ibid.  In  August  1983,
S.  I.  informed  respondents  that  it would  no  longer  accept
their orders.  Ibid.  Spectrum  thereupon  became  national
distributor  of  sorbothane  athletic  shoe  inserts.  Pet.  for
Cert. 6.  Respondents  sought to obtain sorbothane from the
BTR's British subsidiary, but were informed by that subsid-
iary that it would not sell sorbothane in the United States.
Respondents'  business failed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A8.
Respondents sued petitioners seeking damages for alleged
violations of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. §§ 1

and 2,2  § 3 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731,  15 U. S. C. § 14,
the  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt  Organizations  Act
(RICO),  18  U. S. C.  § 1962, and  two provisions  of California
business law.  Respondents also alleged fraud, breach of oral
contract, interference  with prospective business advantage,
bad-faith  denial  of the  existence  of an  oral  contract,  and
conversion.
The  case  was  tried to  a jury, which  returned  a  verdict
against one or more of the defendants  on each of the 11  al-
leged violations on which it was to return a verdict.  All of
the defendants  were  found  to have  violated  §2 by, in  the
words of the verdict sheet, "monopolizing, attempting to mo-
nopolize, and/or conspiring to monopolize."  App. 410.  Peti-
tioners were also found to have violated civil RICO and the
California  unfair practices  law, but not  § 1 of the Sherman
Act.  The jury awarded $1,743,000  in compensatory damages
on  each  of  the  violations  found  to  have  occurred.3   This
amount was trebled under § 4 of the Clayton Act.  The Dis-
trict Court also awarded nearly $1 million in attorney's fees
and denied  motions  for judgment notwithstanding  the ver-
dict and for a new trial.
2 Two violations of § 1 were alleged, resale price maintenance and divi-
sion of territories.  Attempted monopolization, monopolization,  and con-
spiracy to  monopolize  were charged under  § 2.  All in  all, four alleged
violations of federal  law and seven alleged violations of state law were
sent to the jury.
' The special verdict form advised the jury as follows:
"The following pages identify the name of each defendant and the claims
for which plaintiffs contend that the defendant is liable.  If you find that
any of the defendants  are liable  on any of the  claims, you may  award
damages to the plaintiffs against those defendants.  Should you decide to
award damages, please assess damages for each defendant and each claim
separately and without regard to whether you have already awarded the
same damages on another claim or against another defendant.  The court
will insure that there is no double recovery.  The verdict will not be to-
taled."  App. 416.

SPECTRUM SPORTS, INC. v. McQUILLAN
Opinion of the Court
The  Court of Appeals for the  Ninth Circuit affirmed  the
judgment in an unpublished opinion.  Judgt. order reported
at 907 F. 2d  154 (1990).  The court expressly ruled that the
trial court had properly instructed the jury on the Sherman
Act claims and found that the evidence supported the liabil-
ity verdicts as well as the damages  awards on these claims.
The court then affirmed the judgment of the District Court,
finding  it unnecessary  to rule on challenges  to other viola-
tions found by the jury.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A28.  On the
§ 2 issue that petitioners present here, the Court of Appeals,
noting that the jury had found that petitioners had violated
§ 2  without  specifying  whether  they  had  monopolized,  at-
tempted to monopolize, or conspired to monopolize, held that
the verdict would stand if the evidence supported any one of
the three possible violations of § 2.  Id., at A15.  The court
went on to conclude that a case of attempted monopolization
had been established.4   The court rejected petitioners' argu-
ment  that  attempted  monopolization  had  not  been  estab-
lished because respondents had failed to prove that petition-
ers had  a specific  intent  to  monopolize  a relevant  market.
The court also held that in order to show that respondents'
4T he District Court's jury instructions were transcribed as follows:
"In order to win on the claim of attempted monopoly, the Plaintiff must
prove each of the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence:
first, that the Defendants had a specific intent to achieve monopoly power
in the relevant market; second, that the Defendants engaged in exclusion-
ary or restrictive conduct in furtherance of its specific intent; third, that
there was a dangerous probability that Defendants could sooner or later
achieve [their] goal of monopoly power in the relevant market; fourth, that
the Defendants' conduct occurred in or affected interstate commerce; and,
fifth, that the  Plaintiff was injured  in the business or property by the
Defendants' exclusionary or restrictive conduct.
"If the Plaintiff has shown  that the  Defendant engaged  in predatory
conduct, you may infer from that evidence the specific intent and the dan-
gerous probability element of the offense without any proof of the relevant
market or the Defendants' marketing [sic] power."  Id., at 251-252.  See
also App. to Pet. for Cert. A16, A20.

Opinion of the Court
attempt to monopolize was likely to succeed it was not neces-
sary  to present  evidence  of the relevant  market  or of the
defendants'  market power.  In  so doing, the Ninth Circuit
relied on Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327  F. 2d 459  (CA9),
cert. denied, 377 U. S. 993 (1964),  and its progeny.  App. to
Pet. for Cert. A18-A19.  The Court of Appeals noted that
these cases,  in dealing with attempt to monopolize  claims,
had ruled that "if evidence of unfair or predatory conduct is
presented, it may satisfy both the specific intent and danger-
ous probability elements of the offense, without any proof of
relevant market or the defendant's marketpower [sic]."  Id.,
at A19.  If, however, there is insufficient evidence of unfair
or predatory conduct, there must be a showing of "relevant
market or the defendant's marketpower [sic]."  Ibid.  The
court went on to find:
"There  is  sufficient  evidence  from  which  the jury
could conclude that the S. I. Group and Spectrum Group
engaged  in  unfair  or  predatory  conduct  and  thus  in-
ferred that they had the specific intent and the danger-
ous probability of success and, therefore, McQuillan  did
not have to  prove  relevant  market  or the  defendant's
marketing power."  Id., at A21.
The  decision  below, and  the Lessig line  of decisions  on
which it relies, conflicts with holdings of courts in other Cir-
cuits.  Every  other  Court  of  Appeals  has  indicated  that
proving an attempt to monopolize requires proof of a danger-
ous probability of monopolization of a relevant market.5  We

flict among the Circuits.6  We reverse.

While § 1 of the Sherman Act forbids contracts or conspira-
cies in restraint of trade or commerce, § 2 addresses the ac-
tions of single firms that monopolize or attempt to monopo-
lize, as well as conspiracies and combinations to monopolize.
Section 2 does not define  the elements of the offense of at-
tempted monopolization.  Nor is there much guidance  to be
had  in the scant legislative  history of that provision, which
was added late in the legislative process.  See 1 E. Kintner,
Legislative History of the Federal Antitrust Laws and Re-
lated Statutes 23-25 (1978);  3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Anti-
trust Law  617, pp. 39-41  (1978).  The  legislative history
does indicate that much of the interpretation of the necessar-
ily broad principles of the Act was  to be left for the courts
in  particular  cases.  See,  e. g.,  21  Cong.  Rec.  2460  (1890)
(statement of Sen. Sherman).  See also 1 Kintner, supra, at
19; 3 Areeda & Turner, supra,  617, at 40.
This Court first addressed the meaning of attempt to mo-
nopolize under § 2 in Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S.
375 (1905).  The Court's opinion, written by Justice Holmes,
contained the following passage:
tries Corp. v. Hartz Mountain Corp., 810 F. 2d 795, 804 (CA8 1987); Colo-
rado Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America, 885 F. 2d
683, 693 (CA10 1989), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 972 (1990); Key Enterprises
of Delaware, Inc. v. Venice Hospital, 919 F. 2d 1550, 1565 (CAll 1990);
Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co., 252 U. S. App. D. C. 11, 15-16, 786 F. 2d
424, 428-429, cert. denied, 479  U. S.  851  (1986);  Abbott Laboratories v.
Brennan, 952  F. 2d  1346,  1354  (CA Fed.  1991),  cert. denied, 505  U. S.
1205 (1992).
" Our grant of certiorari was limited to the first question presented in
the petition: "Whether a manufacturer's  distributor expressly absolved of
violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act can, without any evidence of mar-
ket power or specific intent, be found liable for attempting to monopolize
solely by virtue of a unique Ninth Circuit rule?"  Pet. for Cert. i.

Opinion of the Court
"Where acts are not sufficient in themselves to produce
a  result which  the law seeks  to prevent-for instance,
the monopoly-but  require  further acts  in  addition  to
the mere forces  of nature to bring that result to pass,
an  intent  to  bring it to pass  is  necessary  in  order to
produce  a  dangerous  probability  that  it  will  happen.
Commonwealth v. Peaslee, 177  Massachusetts  267, 272
[59 N. E. 55, 56 (1901)].  But when that intent and the
consequent dangerous probability exist, this statute, like
many  others  and  like the  common  law  in some  cases,
directs itself against that dangerous  probability as well
as against the completed result."  Id., at 396.
The  Court went on to explain,  however, that not every act
done with intent to produce an unlawful result constitutes an
attempt.  "It is a question of proximity and degree."  Id., at
402.  Swift thus indicated that intent is necessary, but alone
is not sufficient, to establish the dangerous probability of suc-
cess that is the object of § 2's prohibition of attempts.7
The  Court's decisions  since Swift have reflected the view
that  the plaintiff charging  attempted  monopolization  must
prove  a  dangerous  probability  of  actual  monopolization,
which  has  generally  required  a  definition  of the  relevant
market and examination of market power.  In Walker Proc-
ess Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp.,
382  U. S.  172,  177  (1965),  we  found  that  enforcement  of a
fraudulently  obtained  patent  claim  could  violate  the Sher-
man Act.  We stated that, to establish monopolization or at-
tempt to monopolize under § 2 of the Sherman Act, it would
7Justice Holmes confirmed  that this was his interpretation of Swift in
Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347 (1912).  In dissenting in that case on
other grounds, the Justice, citing Swift, stated that an attempt may be
found where the danger of harm  is very great; however, "combination,
intention and overt act may all be present without amounting to a criminal
attempt ....  There must be dangerous proximity to success."  225 U. S.,
at 387-388.

Opinion of the Court
be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal
patent claim in terms of the relevant market for the product
involved.  Ibid.  The reason was that "[w]ithout a definition
of that market there is no way to measure  [the defendant's]
ability to lessen or destroy competition."  Ibid.
Similarly, this Court reaffirmed in Copperweld Corp. v. In-
dependence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752 (1984),  that "Congress
authorized  Sherman Act scrutiny of single firms only when
they  pose  a  danger  of monopolization.  Judging unilateral
conduct  in this manner  reduces  the  risk that the antitrust
laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive
entrepreneur."  Id., at 768.  Thus, the conduct of a  single
firm,  governed  by  § 2,  "is  unlawful  only when it  threatens
actual monopolization."  Id., at 767.  See also Lorain Jour-
nal Co. v.  United States, 342  U. S.  143,  154  (1951);  United
States v. Griffith, 334  U. S.  100,  105-106  (1948);  American
Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S. 781, 785 (1946).
The Courts of Appeals other than the Ninth Circuit have
followed  this  approach.  Consistent  with  our  cases,  it  is
generally required that to demonstrate attempted monopoli-
zation  a  plaintiff  must  prove  (1)  that  the  defendant  has
engaged in predatory or anticompetitive  conduct  with (2) a
specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous  probability
of  achieving  monopoly  power.  See  3  Areeda  &  Turner,
supra,  820, at 312.  In order to determine  whether  there
is  a  dangerous  probability  of monopolization,  courts  have
found  it necessary  to consider the  relevant  market and the
defendant's  ability to  lessen or destroy  competition  in  that
8
market.
"See, e. g., Arthur S. Langenderfer, Inc. v. S. E. Johnson Co., 917 F. 2d,
at 1431-1432;  Twin Laboratories,I nc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.
2d, at 570; Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of
America, 885 F. 2d, at 693; Indiana Grocery, Inc. v. Super Valu Stores,

Opinion of the Court
Notwithstanding the array of authority contrary to Lessig,
the Court of Appeals in this case reaffirmed  its prior hold-
ings; indeed, it did not mention either this Court's decisions
discussed  above  or the many  decisions  of other  Courts  of
Appeals reaching contrary results.  Respondents urge us to
affirm the decision  below.  We are not at all inclined,  how-
ever, to embrace  Lessig's interpretation  of § 2,  for there is
little, if any, support for it in the statute or the case law, and
the notion that proof of unfair or predatory conduct alone is
sufficient to make out the offense of attempted monopoliza-
tion is  contrary  to the purpose  and  policy of the Sherman
Act.
The Lessig opinion claimed  support from the language of
§ 2,  which  prohibits  attempts  to  monopolize  "any  part" of
commerce, and therefore forbids attempts to monopolize any
appreciable  segment  of  interstate  sales  of  the  relevant
product.  See United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218,
226  (1947).  The  "any  part"  clause,  however,  applies  to
charges of monopolization as well as to attempts to monopo-
lize, and it is beyond doubt that the former requires proof of
market power in a relevant market.  United States v. Grin-
nell Corp., 384  U. S.  563,  570-571  (1966);  United States v.
E.  I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351  U. S. 377, 404 (1956).9
In support of its determination  that an inference  of dan-
gerous probability was permissible from a showing of intent,
the Lessig opinion cited, and added emphasis to, this Court's
reference  in  its opinion  in Swift to  "'intent  and  the conse-
quent dangerous probability."'  327 F. 2d, at 474, n. 46, quot-
ing 196 U. S., at 396.  But any question whether dangerous
9 Lessig cited  United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S., at 226, in sup-
port of its interpretation, but Yellow Cab relied on the "any part" language
to support the proposition that it is immaterial how large an amount of
interstate trade is affected, or how important that part of commerce is in
relation to the entire amount of that type of commerce in the Nation.

Opinion of the Court
probability  of success  requires  proof  of more  than  intent
alone should have been removed by the subsequent passage
in Swift which stated that "not every act that may be done
with intent to produce an unlawful result ...  constitutes an
attempt.  It is  a  question  of proximity  and  degree."  Id.,
at 402.
The Lessig court  also relied  on a footnote  in Du Pont &
Co.,  supra, at 395, n. 23, for the proposition that when the
charge is attempt to monopolize, the relevant market is "not
in issue."  That footnote, which  appeared in analysis  of the
relevant  market  issue  in  Du  Pont, rejected  the  Govern-
ment's reliance on several cases, noting that "the scope of the
market was not in issue" in Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson
Parchment Paper Co., 282 U. S. 555 (1931).  That reference
merely reflected  the  fact  that, in Story Parchment, which
was not an  attempt to monopolize case, the parties  did not
challenge the definition of the market adopted by the lower
courts.  Nor was Du Pont itself concerned with the issue in
this case.
It is also our view that Lessig and later Ninth Circuit deci-
sions refining and applying it are inconsistent with the policy
of the Sherman Act.  The purpose  of the Act is not to pro-
tect businesses from the working of the market; it is to pro-
tect the public from the failure of the market.  The law di-
rects  itself not against  conduct  which  is competitive,  even
severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to de-
stroy competition itself.  It does so not out of solicitude for
private concerns but out of concern for the public interest.
See, e. g., Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429
U. S.  477, 488 (1977);  Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado,
Inc., 479 U. S.  104, 116-117 (1986); Brown Shoe Co. v. United
States, 370 U. S. 294, 320 (1962).  Thus, this Court and other
courts have been careful to avoid  constructions  of § 2 which
might chill  competition,  rather  than foster it.  It is  some-

Opinion of the Court
times difficult to distinguish robust competition from conduct
with long-term anticompetitive effects; moreover, single-firm
activity  is  unlike  concerted  activity  covered  by  § 1, which
"inherently  is fraught with anticompetitive  risk."  Copper-
weld, 467  U. S.,  at 767-769.  For  these reasons,  §2 makes
the conduct of a single firm unlawful only  when it actually
monopolizes or dangerously threatens to do so.  Id., at 767.
The concern that § 2 might be applied so as to further anti-
competitive  ends  is  plainly  not  met  by  inquiring  only
whether the defendant  has engaged  in  "unfair"  or "preda-
tory" tactics.  Such conduct  may be sufficient to prove  the
necessary  intent  to  monopolize,  which  is  something  more
than an intent to compete vigorously, but demonstrating the
dangerous  probability of monopolization  in an attempt case
also  requires  inquiry  into  the  relevant  product  and  geo-
graphic market and the defendant's economic  power in that
market.
III
We hold that petitioners may not be liable for attempted
monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act absent proof of
a dangerous probability that they would monopolize a partic-
ular market and specific  intent to monopolize.  In this case,
the trial instructions allowed the jury to infer specific intent
and  dangerous  probability  of  success from  the  defendants'
predatory conduct, without any proof of the relevant market
or of a realistic probability that the defendants could achieve
monopoly  power  in  that  market.  In  this  respect,  the  in-
structions misconstrued § 2,  as did the Court of Appeals  in
affirming the judgment of the District Court.  Since the af-
firmance of the § 2 judgment against petitioners rested solely
on the legally erroneous  conclusion that petitioners had at-
tempted to monopolize in violation of § 2 and since the jury's
verdict did  not  negate  the  possibility  that  the § 2  verdict
rested on the attempt to monopolize  ground alone, the judg-
