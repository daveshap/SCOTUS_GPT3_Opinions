      "reasoning": "The complaints allege that some of the defendant reinsurers threatened to 'withdra[w] entirely from the business of reinsuring primary U. S. insurers who wrote on the occurrence form.' Construed most favorably to respondents, that allegation claims that primary insurers who wrote insurance on disfavored forms would be refused all reinsurance, even as to risks written on other forms."
