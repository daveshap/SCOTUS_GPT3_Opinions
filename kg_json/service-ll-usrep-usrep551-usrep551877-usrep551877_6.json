    "reasoning": "Vertical agreements setting minimum resale prices can have procompetitive justifications, but they may have anticompetitive effects in other cases. Resale price maintenance may facilitate a manufacturer cartel, and it can be abused by a powerful manufacturer or retailer. It cannot be stated with any degree of confidence that resale price maintenance always or almost always tends to restrict competition and decrease output.",
