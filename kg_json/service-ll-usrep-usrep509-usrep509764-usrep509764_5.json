It held that the conduct alleged fell within the grant of antitrust immunity contained in § 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. § 1012(b), because it amounted to \"the business of insurance\" and was \"regulated by State Law\" within the meaning of that section; none of the conduct, in the District Court's view, amounted to a \"boycott\" within the meaning of the § 3(b) exception to that grant of immunity. 15 U. S. C. § 1013(b)."
