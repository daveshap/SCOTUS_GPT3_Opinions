  "opinion": {
    "@type": "LegalOpinion",
    "description": "The District Court found that the allegations in the complaint did not state a per se violation of the Sherman Act because they did not establish the sort of 'manifestly anti-competitive implications or pernicious effect on competition' that would justify per se prohibition of State Oil's conduct. Subsequently, in ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court concluded that respondents had failed to demonstrate antitrust injury or harm to competition. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. The court first noted that the agreement between respondents and State Oil did indeed fix maximum gasoline prices by making it 'worthless' for respondents to exceed the suggested retail prices. After reviewing legal and economic aspects of price fixing, the court concluded that State Oil's pricing scheme was a per se antitrust violation under Albrecht v. Herald Co. Although the Court of Appeals characterized Albrecht as 'unsound when decided' and 'inconsistent with later decisions' of this Court, it felt constrained to follow that decision. We granted certiorari to consider two questions, whether State Oil's conduct constitutes a per se violation of the Sherman Act and whether respondents are entitled to recover damages based on that conduct."
