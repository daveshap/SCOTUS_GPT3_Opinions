  "reasoningForIncluding": [
    "Vertical price restraints can facilitate a retailer cartel or support a dominant, inefﬁcient retailer.",
    "Manufacturers have an incentive to protest inefﬁcient retailer-induced price restraints because they can harm its competitive position.",
    "Dominant manufacturers or retailers can abuse resale price maintenance for anticompetitive purposes.",
    "The rule of reason is designed and used to eliminate anticompetitive transactions from the market.",
    "Stare decisis does not compel continued adherence to the per se rule against vertical price restraints.",
    "Respected authorities in the economics literature suggest the per se rule is inappropriate.",
    "The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have recommended that this Court replace the per se rule with the traditional rule of reason.",
    "The Court's treatment of vertical restraints has progressed away from Dr. Miles' strict approach."
