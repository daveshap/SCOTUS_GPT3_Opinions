    "reasoning": [
      "such restrictions might avert vertical integration in the distribution process.",
      "The Court drew the line, however, at permitting manufacturers to control product marketing once dominion over the goods had passed to dealers.",
      "The Court concluded that it was per se unlawful for the publisher to fix the maximum resale price of its newspapers.",
      "The Court rejected the notion that, because the newspaper publisher granted exclusive territories, a price ceiling was necessary to protect the public from price gouging by dealers who had monopoly power in their own territories.",
      "Justice Harlan asserted that the majority had erred in equating the effects of maximum and minimum price fixing.",
      "The Court acknowledged the principle of stare decisis, but explained that the need for clarification in the law justified reconsideration of Schwinn.",
      "The Court considered the historical context of Schwinn, noting that Schwinn's per se rule against vertical nonprice restrictions came only four years after the Court had refused to endorse a similar rule in White Motor Co.",
      "The Court then reviewed scholarly works supporting the economic utility of vertical nonprice restraints.",
      "The Court declined to comment on Albrecht's per se treatment of vertical maximum price restrictions, noting that the issue \"involve[d] significantly different questions of analysis and policy.\"",
      "Subsequent decisions of the Court have hinted that the analytical underpinnings of Albrecht were substantially weakened by GTE Sylvania.",
      "Most recently, in ARCO, the Court signaled some disfavor with Albrecht's decision, and specifically acknowledged that vertical maximum price fixing \"may have procompetitive interbrand effects.\""
