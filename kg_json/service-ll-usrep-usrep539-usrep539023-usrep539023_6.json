    "name": "Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.",
    "datePublished": "Opinion of the Court",
    "caseNumber": "ยง 103(a)",
    "involvedParties": ["Fox", "Doubleday", "Dastar"],
    "reasoning": "Had Fox renewed the copyright in the Crusade television series, it would have had an easy claim of copyright infringement. And respondents' contention that Campaigns infringes Doubleday's copyright in General Eisenhower's book is still a live question on remand. If, moreover, the producer of a video that substantially copied the Crusade series were, in advertising or promotion, to give purchasers the impression that the video was quite different from that series, then one or more of the respondents might have a cause of action-not for reverse passing off under the 'confusion... as to the origin' provision of ยง 43(a)(1)(A), but for misrepresentation under the 'misrepresents the nature, characteristics [or] qualities' provision of ยง 43(a)(1)(B). For merely saying it is the producer of the video, however, no Lanham Act liability attaches to Dastar.",
    "decision": "We thus have no occasion to consider whether the Lanham Act permitted an award of double petitioner's profits. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",
    "justices": ["Justice Breyer"]
