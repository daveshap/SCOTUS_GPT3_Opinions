        "Recognizing in § 43(a) a cause of action for misrepresentation of authorship of noncopyrighted works (visual or otherwise) would render these limitations superfluous.",
        "A statutory interpretation that renders another statute superfluous is of course to be avoided.",
        "Reading \"origin\" in §43(a) to require attribution of uncopyrighted materials would pose serious practical problems.",
        "Without a copyrighted work as the basepoint, the word \"origin\" has no discernable limits.",
        "Manufacturers of communicative products would face Lanham Act liability for failing to credit the creator of a work on which their lawful copies are based.",
        "Reading § 43(a) of the Lanham Act as creating a cause of action for, in effect, plagiarism-the use of otherwise unprotected works and inventions without attribution-would be hard to reconcile with previous decisions.",
        "The \"origin of goods\" provision of § 43(a) would have supported the suit that was rejected in Bonito Boats.",
        "The \"origin of goods\" provision of § 43(a) would have supported the suit that was rejected in TrafFix.",
        "The creative talent of the sort that lay behind the Campaigns videos is not left without protection."
