      "involvedParties": "Minneapolis and St. Louis R. Co. v. U. S.",
      "reasoning": "Unequivocally contemplates the disappearance of the Western as an independent and neutral connection for the other 15 carriers with which it presently works; for all practical purposes the Western would be integrated, consolidated, and merged into the Minneapolis for ownership, management, and operation; features of the Minneapolis plan would be extremely harmful to other carriers; Western's headquarters office at Peoria would be eliminated, leaving only a trainmaster and a roadmaster at that point, and the employment of most of Western's 24 executives and 225 other employees would be severed."
