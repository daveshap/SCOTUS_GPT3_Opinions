46  ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v. INDEPENDENT INK, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
Today, we reach the same conclusion, and therefore hold that, 
in all cases involving a tying arrangement, the plaintiff must 
prove  that  the  defendant  has  market  power  in  the  tying 
product. 
VI 
In  this  case,  respondent  reasonably relied  on  our  prior 
opinions in moving for summary judgment without offering 
evidence deﬁning the relevant market or proving that peti­
tioners possess power within it.  When the case returns to 
the District Court, respondent should therefore be given a 
fair opportunity to develop and introduce evidence on that 
issue, as well as any other issues that are relevant to its 
remaining  § 1  claims.  Accordingly,  the  judgment  of  the 
Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
It is so ordered. 
Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or deci­
sion of this case.
