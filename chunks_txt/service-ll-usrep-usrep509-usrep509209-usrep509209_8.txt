tion it portends, may be  the injury to competition  the Act
prohibits.  See,  e. g.,  United States v.  Philadelphia Nat.
Bank, 374 U. S. 321 (1963).  We adhere  to "the normal rule
of statutory construction that identical words used in differ-
ent  parts of the same  act are  intended  to have  the same
meaning."  Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990)  (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted).  See also J  Truett Payne
Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U. S. 557, 562 (1981) (evalu-
ating  the  competitive  injury  requirement  of  Robinson-
Patman  Act  ยง2(a)  in  light  of analogous  interpretations  of
Clayton Act ยง 7).  We decline to create a per se rule of nonli-
ability for predatory price discrimination  when recoupment
is alleged to take place through supracompetitive  oligopoly
pricing.  Cf. Cargill,4 79 U. S., at 121.

Although Liggett's theory of liability, as an abstract mat-
ter, is within  the  reach  of the  statute, we  agree  with the
Court of Appeals  and the District Court that  Liggett was
not entitled to submit its case to the jury.  It is not custom-
ary for this Court to review the sufficiency of the evidence,
but we will do so when the issue is properly before us and
the benefits of providing guidance  concerning the proper ap-
plication of a legal standard and avoiding the systemic costs
associated with further proceedings justify the required ex-
penditure of judicial resources.  See, e. g., Aspen Skiing Co.
v.  Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472  U. S.  585,  605-611
(1985);  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S.
752, 765-768 (1984);  United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384
U. S.  546,  550-552  (1966).  The record  in this  case demon-
strates  that  the  anticompetitive  scheme  Liggett  alleged,
when judged against  the realities  of the market, does  not
provide an adequate basis for a finding of liability.

Opinion of the Court
and effect: Brown & Williamson would enter the generic seg-
ment with list prices  matching Liggett's but with massive,
discriminatory volume rebates directed  at Liggett's biggest
wholesalers; as a result, the net price of Brown & William-
son's generics would be below its costs; Liggett would suffer
losses trying to defend its market share and wholesale cus-
tomer base by matching Brown  & Williamson's  rebates; to
avoid further losses,  Liggett would  raise  its list prices  on
generics  or acquiesce  in price  leadership by Brown  & Wil-
liamson; higher  list prices  to consumers  would  shrink the
percentage gap in retail price between generic and branded
cigarettes; and this narrowing of the gap would make gener-
ics less appealing to the consumer, thus slowing the growth
of  the  economy  segment  and  reducing  cannibalization  of
branded sales and their associated supracompetitive profits.
Although  Brown  & Williamson's  entry  into  the  generic
segment could  be  regarded  as procompetitive  in  intent  as
well as  effect, the record  contains  sufficient  evidence  from
which  a  reasonable  jury  could  conclude  that  Brown  &
Williamson  envisioned  or  intended  this  anticompetitive
course  of events.  See, e.g .,  App.  57-58,  67-68,  89-91,  99,
112-114, 200, 241, 253, 257, 262-263, 279-280, 469-470, 664-
666.  There  is  also  sufficient  evidence  in  the record  from
which a reasonable jury could conclude that for a period of
approximately  18  months, Brown  & Williamson's  prices on
its generic  cigarettes  were below its costs, see id., at 338-
339, 651, 740, and that this below-cost pricing imposed losses
on Liggett that Liggett was unwilling to sustain, given its
corporate parent's  effort to locate a buyer for the company,
see  id., at 74,  92, 200, 253, 596-597.  Liggett  has failed  to
demonstrate competitive injury as a matter of law, however,
because its proof is flawed in a critical respect: The evidence
is inadequate to show that in pursuing this scheme, Brown &
Williamson had a reasonable prospect of recovering its losses
from below-cost  pricing through  slowing the growth of ge-
nerics.  As we have noted, "[t]he  success of any predatory

scheme  depends  on  maintaining  monopoly  power  for  long
enough both to  recoup the predator's losses and to harvest
some  additional  gain."  Matsushita, 475  U. S.,  at 589  (em-
phasis omitted).
No inference  of recoupment is sustainable  on this record,
because  no  evidence  suggests  that  Brown  & Williamson-
whatever its intent in introducing black and whites may have
been-was likely to obtain the power to raise the prices for
generic  cigarettes  above a  competitive  level.  Recoupment
through supracompetitive pricing in the economy segment of
the cigarette market is an indispensable aspect of Liggett's
own  proffered  theory, because  a  slowing  of growth in  the
economy  segment,  even  if it results  from  an  increase  in
generic  prices,  is not itself anticompetitive.  Only  if those
higher prices are a product of nonmarket forces  has compe-
tition  suffered.  If prices  rise in response  to an  excess  of
demand over supply, or segment growth slows as patterns of
consumer preference become stable, the market is function-
ing in  a competitive  manner.  Consumers  are  not injured
from the perspective  of the antitrust laws  by the price  in-
creases;  they are in fact  causing them.  Thus, the linchpin
of the  predatory  scheme  alleged  by  Liggett  is  Brown  &
Williamson's  ability,  with  the  other  oligopolists,  to  raise
prices above  a competitive  level in  the generic  segment  of
the market.  Because  relying on  tacit  coordination  among
oligopolists  as a means  of recouping losses from predatory
pricing  is  "highly  speculative,"  Areeda  &  Hovenkamp
711.2c, at 647, competent evidence is necessary to allow a
reasonable inference that it poses an authentic threat to com-
petition.  The evidence in this case is insufficient to demon-
strate the danger of Brown & Williamson's  alleged  scheme.
