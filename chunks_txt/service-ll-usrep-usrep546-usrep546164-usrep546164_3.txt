170  VOLVO TRUCKS NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. REEDER-
SIMCO GMC, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
resale of the purchased product.  Competition of that char­
acter ordinarily is not involved when a product subject to 
special order is sold through a customer-speciﬁc competitive 
bidding process. 
I 
Volvo manufactures heavy-duty trucks.  Reeder sells new 
and used trucks, including heavy-duty trucks.  374 F. 3d 701, 
704  (CA8  2004).  Reeder  became  an  authorized  dealer  of 
Volvo trucks in 1995, pursuant to a ﬁve-year franchise agree­
ment  that  provided  for  automatic  one-year  extensions  if 
Reeder met sales objectives set by Volvo.  Ibid.  Reeder 
generally sold Volvo’s trucks through a competitive bidding 
process.  Ibid.  In  this  process,  the  retail  customer  de­
scribes  its  speciﬁc  product  requirements  and  invites  bids 
from several dealers it selects.  The customer’s “decision to 
request a bid from a particular dealer or to allow a particular 
dealer to bid is controlled by such factors as an existing rela­
tionship,  geography,  reputation,  and  cold  calling  or  other 
marketing strategies initiated by individual dealers.”  Id., 
at  719  (Hansen,  J.,  concurring  in  part  and  dissenting  in 
part). 
Once a Volvo dealer receives the customer’s speciﬁcations, 
it turns to Volvo and requests a discount or “concession” off 
the wholesale price (set at 80% of the published retail price). 
Id., at 704.  It is common practice in the industry for manu­
facturers to offer customer-speciﬁc discounts to their dealers. 
Ibid.; App. 334, 337.  Volvo decides on a case-by-case basis 
whether to offer a discount and, if so, what the discount rate 
will be, taking account of such factors as industry-wide de­
mand and whether the retail customer has, historically, pur­
chased a different brand of trucks.  App. 348–349, 333–334.1 
The dealer then uses the discount offered by Volvo in prepar­
1 To shield its ability to compete with other manufacturers, Volvo keeps 
conﬁdential its precise method for calculating concessions offered to deal­
ers.  374 F. 3d 701, 704–705 (CA8 2004); App. 337–338.

Opinion of the Court 
ing its bid; it purchases trucks from Volvo only if and when 
the retail customer accepts its bid.  Ibid. 
Reeder was one of many Volvo dealers, each assigned by 
Volvo to a geographic territory.  Reeder’s territory encom­
passed ten counties in Arkansas and two in Oklahoma.  374 
F. 3d, at 709.  Although nothing prohibits a Volvo dealer 
from bidding outside its territory, ibid., Reeder rarely bid 
against  another  Volvo  dealer,  see  id.,  at  705;  5  App.  in 
No. 02–2462 (CA8), pp. 1621–1622 (hereinafter C. A. App.). 
In the atypical event that the same retail customer solicited 
a bid from more than one Volvo dealer, Volvo’s stated policy 
was to provide the same price concession to each dealer com­
peting head to head for the same sale.  4 id., at 1161–1162; 
5 id., at 1619, 1621. 
In 1997, Volvo announced a program it called “Volvo Vi­
sion,” in which the company addressed problems it faced in 
the market for heavy trucks, among them, the company’s 
assessment that it had too many dealers.  Volvo projected 
enlarging the size of its dealers’ markets and reducing the 
number of dealers from 146 to 75.  374 F. 3d, at 705.  Coinci­
dentally, Reeder learned that Volvo had given another dealer 
a price concession greater than the concessions Reeder typi­
cally received, and “Reeder came to suspect it was one of the 
dealers Volvo sought to eliminate.”  Ibid.  Reeder ﬁled suit 
against Volvo in February 2000, alleging losses attributable 
to Volvo’s violation of the Arkansas Franchise Practices Act 
and the Robinson-Patman Act. 
At  trial,  Reeder’s  vice-president,  William  E.  Heck,  ac­
knowledged that Volvo’s policy was to offer equal conces­
sions to Volvo dealers bidding against one another for a par­
ticular contract, but he contended that the policy “was not 
executed.”  4 C. A. App. 1162.  Reeder presented evidence 
concerning two instances over the ﬁve-year course of its au­
thorized  dealership  when  Reeder bid  against  other  Volvo 
dealers  for  a  particular  sale.  374 F.  3d,  at  705,  708–709. 
One of the two instances involved Reeder’s bid on a sale to

172  VOLVO TRUCKS NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. REEDER-
SIMCO GMC, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
Tommy Davidson Trucking.  4 C. A. App. 1267–1268.  Volvo 
initially offered Reeder a concession of 17%, which Volvo, 
unprompted, increased to 18.1% and then, one week later, to 
18.9%, to match the concession Volvo had offered to another 
of its dealers.  5 id., at 1268–1272.  Neither dealer won the 
bid.  Id.,  at  1272.  The  other  instance  involved  Hiland 
Dairy, which solicited bids from both Reeder and Southwest 
Missouri Truck Center.  Id., at 1626–1627.  Per its written 
policy, Volvo offered the two dealers the same concession, 
and Hiland selected Southwest Missouri, a dealer from which 
Hiland had previously purchased trucks.  Ibid.  After se­
lecting  Southwest  Missouri,  Hiland  insisted  on  the  price 
Southwest Missouri had bid prior to a general increase in 
Volvo’s prices; Volvo obliged by increasing the size of the 
discount.  Id., at 1627.  See also id., at 1483–1488; 374 F. 3d, 
at 720 (Hansen, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). 
Reeder  dominantly  relied  on  comparisons  between  con­
cessions Volvo offered when Reeder bid against non-Volvo 
dealers, with concessions accorded to other Volvo dealers 
similarly bidding against non-Volvo dealers for other sales. 
Reeder’s evidence compared concessions Reeder received on 
four  occasions  when  it  bid  successfully  against  non-Volvo 
dealers (and thus purchased Volvo trucks), with more favor­
able concessions other successful Volvo dealers received in 
connection with bidding processes in which Reeder did not 
participate.  Id., at 705–706.  Reeder also compared conces­
sions offered by Volvo on several occasions when Reeder bid 
unsuccessfully against non-Volvo dealers (and therefore did 
not purchase Volvo trucks), with more favorable concessions 
received  by  other  Volvo  dealers  who  gained  contracts  on 
which Reeder did not bid.  Id., at 706–707. 
Reeder’s vice-president, Heck, testiﬁed that Reeder did 
not look for instances in which it received a larger concession 
than another Volvo dealer, although he acknowledged it was 
“quite possible” that such instances occurred.  5 C. A. App. 
1462.  Nor did Reeder endeavor to determine by any sta­
