and Food Employers' Pension Trust Fund, 638 F. Supp. 885,
887 (SD Cal. 1986), aff'd, 827 F. 2d 491 (CA9 1987),  cert. de-
nied, 485 U. S. 1008 (1988).  We proceed on that assumption.
Multiemployer bargaining itself is a well-established, im-
portant, pervasive method of collective bargaining, offering
advantages to both management  and labor.  See Appendix,
infra, p. 251  (multiemployer bargaining  accounts  for more
than 40% of major collective-bargaining  agreements, and is
used in such industries as construction, transportation, retail
trade, clothing manufacture, and real estate, as well as pro-
fessional sports); NLRB v.  Truck Drivers, 353  U. S.8 7, 95
(1957)  (Buffalo Linen) (Congress  saw  multiemployer bar-
gaining as "a vital factor in the effectuation  of the national
policy of promoting labor peace through strengthened collec-
tive bargaining");  Charles D. Bonanno Linen Service, Inc.
v. NLRB, 454  U. S.4 04, 409, n. 3  (1982)  (Bonanno Linen)
(multiemployer bargaining  benefits  both  management  and
labor, by saving bargaining resources, by encouraging devel-
opment  of  industry-wide  worker  benefits  programs  that
smaller employers could not otherwise afford, and by inhibit-
ing employer competition at the workers' expense); Brief for
Respondent  NLRB in Bonanno Linen, 0. T. 1981, No. 80-
931,  p.  10,  n.  7  (same);  General  Subcommittee  on  Labor,
House Committee  on  Education  and  Labor, Multiemployer
Association Bargaining and its Impact on the Collective Bar-
gaining Process, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 10-19, 32-33  (Comm.
Print 1964) (same); see also C. Bonnett, Employers' Associa-
tions in the United States: A Study of Typical Associations
(1922)  (history).  The  upshot is that  the practice  at issue
here plays a significant role in a collective-bargaining process
that itself constitutes  an important part of the Nation's in-
dustrial relations system.
In these circumstances, to subject the practice to antitrust
law is to require antitrust courts to answer a host of impor-
tant practical questions about how collective bargaining over

wages,  hours,  and  working conditions  is  to  proceed-the

very result that the implicit labor exemption seeks to avoid.
And it is to place in jeopardy some of the potentially benefi-
cial labor-related effects that multiemployer  bargaining can
achieve.  That is because unlike labor law, which sometimes
welcomes  anticompetitive  agreements  conducive  to  indus-
trial harmony, antitrust law forbids  all agreements  among
competitors  (such as  competing  employers) that unreason-
ably lessen competition among or between them in virtually
any  respect  whatsoever.  See,  e. g.,  Paramount Famous
Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U. S. 30 (1930) (agreement
to insert arbitration  provisions in motion picture licensing
contracts).  Antitrust law also sometimes permits judges or
juries to premise antitrust liability upon little more than uni-
form behavior  among  competitors,  preceded  by conversa-
tions implying that later uniformity might prove desirable,
see, e. g.,  United States v. General Motors Corp., 384  U. S.
127, 142-143  (1966);  United States v. Foley, 598 F. 2d 1323,
1331-1332 (CA4 1979), cert. denied, 444 U. S. 1043 (1980), or
accompanied by other conduct that in context suggests that
each competitor failed to make an independent decision, see,
e. g., American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S. 781,
809-810 (1946);  United States v. Masonite Corp., 316  U. S.
265, 275 (1942); Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306
U. S. 208, 226-227 (1939).  See generally 6 P. Areeda, Anti-
trust  Law  1416-1427  (1986);  Turner, The  Definition  of
Agreement Under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism
and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 655 (1962).
If the antitrust laws apply, what are employers to do once
impasse is reached?  If all impose terms similar to their last
joint  offer,  they invite  an  antitrust  action  premised  upon
identical behavior (along with prior or accompanying conver-
sations)  as  tending  to  show  a  common  understanding  or
agreement.  If any, or all, of them individually impose terms
that differ significantly from that offer, they invite an unfair

labor  practice  charge.  Indeed,  how  can  employers  safely
discuss  their offers  together  even before  a bargaining  im-
passe occurs?  A preimpasse discussion about, say, the prac-
tical advantages  or disadvantages  of a particular  proposal
invites a later antitrust claim that they agreed  to limit the
kinds  of  action  each  would  later  take  should  an  impasse
occur.  The same  is true of postimpasse discussions  aimed
at renewed negotiations with the union.  Nor would adher-
ence to the terms of an expired collective-bargaining  agree-
ment eliminate a potentially plausible antitrust claim charg-
ing that they had "conspired"  or tacitly "agreed" to do  so,
particularly  if maintaining the status  quo were  not in the
immediate  economic  self-interest  of  some.  Cf. Interstate
Circuit,s upra, at 222-223; 6 Areeda, supra,  1425.  All this
is to say that to permit antitrust liability here threatens to
introduce  instability  and  uncertainty  into  the  collective-
bargaining process, for antitrust law often forbids or discour-
ages  the  kinds  of joint discussions  and  behavior  that  the
collective-bargaining process invites or requires.
We  do not see any obvious  answer to this problem.  We
recognize,  as  the  Government  suggests, that, in principle,
antitrust courts might themselves try to evaluate particular
kinds of employer understandings, finding them "reasonable"
(hence lawful) where justified by collective-bargaining neces-
sity.  But any such evaluation means a web of detailed rules
spun  by  many  different  nonexpert  antitrust  judges  and
juries, not a set of labor rules enforced  by a single  expert
administrative body, namely the Board.  The labor laws give
the Board, not  antitrust courts, primary responsibility  for
policing the collective-bargaining process.  And one of their
objectives  was  to take from  antitrust courts the authority
to determine, through application of the antitrust laws, what
is  socially  or  economically  desirable  collective-bargaining
policy.  See supra, at 236-237; see also Jewel Tea, 381 U. S.,
at 716-719 (opinion of Goldberg, J.).
