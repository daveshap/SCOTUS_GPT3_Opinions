406  UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. 
SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
expedited greatly.  If the jury agrees with the court’s 
appraisal of the evidence, and returns a verdict for the 
party who moved for judgment as a matter of law, the 
case is at an end.  If the jury brings in a different ver­
dict, the trial court can grant a renewed motion for judg­
ment as a matter of law.  Then if the appellate court 
holds that the trial court was in error in its appraisal of 
the evidence, it can reverse and order judgment on the 
verdict of the jury, without any need for a new trial. 
For this reason the appellate courts repeatedly have said 
that it usually is desirable to take a verdict, and then 
pass on the sufﬁciency of the evidence on a post-verdict 
motion.”  9A Federal Practice § 2533, at 319 (footnote 
omitted). 
Thus, the District Court’s denial of respondent’s preverdict 
motion cannot form the basis of respondent’s appeal, because 
the denial of that motion was not error.  It was merely an 
exercise of the District Court’s discretion, in accordance with 
the text of the Rule and the accepted practice of permitting 
the jury to make an initial judgment about the sufﬁciency of 
the evidence.  The only error here was counsel’s failure to 
ﬁle a postverdict motion pursuant to Rule 50(b).6 
6 Respondent claims that its failure to renew its Rule 50(a) motion was 
in reliance on the Tenth Circuit’s determination that it could order a new 
trial in the absence of a Rule 50(b) motion.  But respondent cannot credi­
bly maintain that it wanted the Court of Appeals to order a new trial as 
opposed to entering judgment.  And, as the Tenth Circuit has recognized, 
respondent could not obtain the entry of judgment unless it complied with 
Rule 50(b).  Cummings v. General Motors Corp., 365 F. 3d 944, 951 (2004). 
Respondent therefore had every incentive to comply with that Rule’s re­
quirements.  Accordingly, we reject its contention that our application of 
Rule 50(b) to the instant case is impermissibly retroactive.  See also 
Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 97 (1993) (“[W]e can 
scarcely permit the substantive law to shift and spring according to the 
particular equities of individual parties’ claims of actual reliance on an old 
rule and of harm from a retroactive application of the new rule” (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted)).

Stevens, J., dissenting 
* * * 
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that since respondent 
failed to renew its preverdict motion as speciﬁed in Rule 
50(b), there was no basis for review of respondent’s sufﬁ­
ciency of the evidence challenge in the Court of Appeals. 
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.7 
It is so ordered. 
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Kennedy joins, 
dissenting. 
Murphy’s law applies to trial lawyers as well as pilots. 
Even an expert will occasionally blunder.  For that reason 
Congress has preserved the federal appeals courts’ power to 
correct plain error, even though trial counsel’s omission will 
ordinarily give rise to a binding waiver.  This is not a case, 
in my view, in which the authority of the appellate court is 
limited by an explicit statute or controlling rule.  The spirit 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favors preservation 
of a court’s power to avoid manifestly unjust results in ex­
ceptional cases.  See Johnson v. New York, N. H. & H. R. 
Co.,  344  U. S.  48,  62  (1952)  (Frankfurter,  J.,  dissenting) 
(“ ‘Procedure is the means; full, equal and exact enforcement 
of  substantive  law  is  the  end’ ”  (quoting  Pound,  The  Eti­
quette  of  Justice,  3  Proceedings  Neb.  St.  Bar  Assn.  231 
(1909))).  Moreover,  we  have  an  overriding  duty  to  obey 
statutory commands that unambiguously express the intent 
of Congress even in areas such as procedure in which we 
may have special expertise. 
Today, relying primarily on a case decided in March 1947, 
Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U. S. 212, and 
a  case  decided  in  January  1948,  Globe  Liquor  Co.  v.  San 
7 We reject respondent’s contention that it is entitled to a remand for 
reconsideration in light of Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F. 3d 1303 (CA Fed. 
2005).  The Federal Circuit has already denied respondent’s petition for 
rehearing raising this issue.

408  UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. 
SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC. 
Stevens, J., dissenting 
Roman, 332 U. S. 571, the Court holds that the Court of Ap­
peals was “powerless” to review the sufﬁciency of the evi­
dence supporting the verdict in petitioner’s favor because 
respondent failed to ﬁle proper postverdict motions pursuant 
to Rules 50(b) and 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
in the trial court.  Ante, at 405.  The majority’s holding is 
inconsistent with a statute enacted just months after Globe 
Liquor was decided.  That statute, which remains in effect 
today, provides: 
“The Supreme Court or any other court of appellate 
jurisdiction may afﬁrm, modify, vacate, set aside or re­
verse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully 
brought before it for review, and may remand the cause 
and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, de­
cree, or order, or require such further proceedings to 
be had as may be just under the circumstances.”  28 
U. S. C. § 2106. 
Nothing in Rule 50(b) limits this statutory grant of power 
to appellate courts; while a party’s failure to make a Rule 
50(b) motion precludes the district court from directing a 
verdict in that party’s favor, the Rule does not purport to 
strip the courts of appeals of the authority to review district 
court judgments or to order such relief as “may be just under 
the circumstances.”  Nor do general principles of waiver or 
forfeiture have that effect.  Cf. ante, at 404–405.  It is well 
settled that a litigant’s waiver or forfeiture of an argument 
does not, in the absence of a contrary statutory command, 
preclude the courts of appeals from considering those argu­
ments.  See Singleton v.  Wulff,  428 U. S. 106, 121 (1976). 
Arguments raised for the ﬁrst time on appeal may be enter­
tained,  for  example,  if  their  consideration  would  prevent 
manifest injustice.  Ibid.* 
*The Court suggests that the Seventh Amendment limits appellate 
courts’ power to review judgments under 28 U. S. C. § 2106.  See ante, 
at 402–403, n. 4.  I disagree with the Court’s analysis in two respects.
