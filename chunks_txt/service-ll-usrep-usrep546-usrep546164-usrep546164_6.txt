Opinion of the Court 
not affected by differential pricing; a dealer in the competi­
tive bidding process here at issue approaches Volvo for a 
price concession only after it has been selected by a retail 
customer to submit a bid.  Competition for an opportunity 
to bid, we earlier observed, is based on a variety of factors, 
including the existence vel non of a relationship between the 
potential bidder and the customer, geography, and reputa­
tion.  See supra, at 170.3  We reiterate in this regard an 
observation  made  by  Judge  Hansen,  dissenting  from  the 
Eighth Circuit’s Robinson-Patman holding: Once a retail cus­
tomer has chosen the particular dealers from which it will 
solicit  bids,  “the  relevant  market  becomes  limited  to  the 
needs and demands of a particular end user, with only a 
handful  of  dealers  competing  for  the  ultimate  sale.”  374 
F. 3d, at 719.  That Volvo dealers may bid for sales in the 
same geographic area does not import that they in fact com­
peted  for  the  same  customer-tailored  sales.  In  sum,  the 
purchase-to-purchase and offer-to-purchase comparisons fail 
to show that Volvo sold at a lower price to Reeder’s “compet­
itors,” hence those comparisons do not support an inference 
of competitive injury.  See Falls City Industries, 460 U. S., 
at 435 (inference of competitive injury under Morton Salt 
arises from “proof of a substantial price discrimination be­
tween competing purchasers over time” (emphasis added)).

Reeder did offer evidence of two instances in which it com­
peted head to head with another Volvo dealer.  See supra, 
at 171–172.  When multiple dealers bid for the business of 
the same customer, only one dealer will win the business 
and thereafter purchase the supplier’s product to fulﬁll its

may inﬂuence the customer’s bidding invitations.  Cf. post, at 183, n. 2. 
We do not pursue that point here, however, because Reeder did not 
present—or even look for—evidence that Volvo consistently disfavored 
Reeder while it consistently favored certain other dealers.  See supra, 
at 172–173.

Opinion of the Court 
contractual commitment.  Because Robinson-Patman “pro­
hibits only discrimination ‘between different purchasers,’” 
Brief for Petitioner 26 (quoting 15 U. S. C. § 13(a); emphasis 
added), Volvo and the  United States argue, the Act does 
not reach markets characterized by competitive bidding and 
special-order sales, as opposed to sales from inventory.  See 
Brief for Petitioner 27; Brief for United States as Amicus 
Curiae 9, 17–20.  We need not decide that question today. 
Assuming the Act applies to the head-to-head transactions, 
Reeder  did  not  establish  that  it  was  disfavored  vis-a`-vis 
other Volvo dealers in the rare instances in which they com­
peted for the same sale—let alone that the alleged discrimi­
nation  was  substantial.  See  1  ABA  Section  of  Antitrust 
Law, Antitrust Law Developments 478–479 (5th ed. 2002) 
(“No inference of injury to competition is permitted when 
the discrimination is not substantial.” (collecting cases)). 
Reeder’s evidence showed loss of only one sale to another 
Volvo dealer, a sale of 12 trucks that would have generated 
$30,000 in gross proﬁts for Reeder.  374 F. 3d, at 705.  Per 
its policy, Volvo initially offered Reeder and the other dealer 
the same concession.  Volvo ultimately granted a larger con­
cession to the other dealer, but only after it had won the 
bid.  In the only other instance of head-to-head competition 
Reeder identiﬁed, Volvo increased Reeder’s initial 17% dis­
count to 18.9%, to match the discount offered to the other 
competing Volvo dealer; neither dealer won the bid.  See 
supra, at 172.  In short, if price discrimination between two 
purchasers existed at all, it was not of such magnitude as 
to affect substantially competition between Reeder and the 
“favored” Volvo dealer.

Interbrand competition, our opinions afﬁrm, is the “pri­
mary concern of antitrust law.”  Continental T. V., Inc. v. 
GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 51–52, n. 19 (1977).  The 
Robinson-Patman Act signals no large departure from that

Opinion of the Court 
main concern.  Even if the Act’s text could be construed in 
the manner urged by Reeder and embraced by the Court of 
Appeals, we would resist interpretation geared more to the 
protection of existing competitors than to the stimulation of 
competition.4  In the case before us, there is no evidence 
that any favored purchaser possesses market power, the al­
legedly  favored  purchasers  are  dealers  with  little  resem­
blance to large independent department stores or chain oper­
ations, and the supplier’s selective price discounting fosters 
competition among suppliers of different brands.  See id., at 
51–52 (observing that the market impact of a vertical prac­
tice, such as a change in a supplier’s distribution system, may 
be a “simultaneous reduction of intrabrand competition and 
stimulation of interbrand competition”).  By declining to ex­
tend Robinson-Patman’s governance to such cases, we con­
tinue to construe the Act “consistently with broader policies 
of  the  antitrust  laws.”  Brooke  Group,  509  U. S.,  at  220 
(quoting Great Atlantic & Paciﬁc Tea Co. v. FTC, 440 U. S. 
69, 80, n. 13 (1979)); see Automatic Canteen Co. of America 
v. FTC, 346 U. S. 61, 63 (1953) (cautioning against Robinson-
Patman constructions that “extend beyond the prohibitions 
of the Act and, in doing so, help give rise to a price uniform­
ity and rigidity in open conﬂict with the purposes of other 
antitrust legislation”).5 
4 The dissent assails Volvo’s decision to reduce the number of its dealers. 
Post, at 183.  But Robinson-Patman does not bar a manufacturer from 
restructuring its distribution networks to improve the efﬁciency of its op­
erations.  If Volvo did not honor its obligations to Reeder as its fran­
chisee, “[a]ny remedy . . . lies in state laws addressing unfair competition 
and the rights of franchisees, not in the Robinson-Patman Act.”  Brief 
for United States as Amicus Curiae 28. 
5 See also Hovenkamp ¶ 2333c, p. 109 (commenting that the Eighth Cir­
cuit’s expansive interpretation “views the [Robinson-Patman Act] as a 
guarantee of equal proﬁt margins on sales actually made,” and thereby 
exposes manufacturers to treble damages unless they “charge uniform 
prices to their dealers”).
