Thomas, J., dissenting 
fashion, § 28 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 states 
that “the rights and remedies provided by this chapter shall 
be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that 
may exist at law or in equity.”  § 78bb(a).  This Court has 
previously characterized those clauses as “conﬁrm[ing] that 
the remedies in each Act were to be supplemented by ‘any 
and  all’  additional  remedies.”  Herman  &  MacLean  v. 
Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 383 (1983). 
The Sherman Act was enacted in 1890.  See 26 Stat. 209. 
Accordingly, rights and remedies under the federal antitrust 
laws certainly would have been thought of as “rights and 
remedies” that existed “at law or in equity” by the Con­
gresses that enacted that Securities Act and the Securities 
Exchange Act in the early 1930’s.  See § 77p; § 78bb.  There­
fore,  both  statutes  explicitly  save  the  very  remedies  the 
Court holds to be impliedly precluded.  There is no convinc­
ing argument for why these saving provisions should not 
resolve this case in respondents’ favor. 
The Court’s opinion overlooks the saving clauses seem­
ingly because they do not “explicitly state whether they pre­
clude application of the antitrust laws.”  Ante, at 270; see 
also Brief for Petitioners 33, n. 5.1  As the Court observes, 
some  statutes contain  saving clauses  speciﬁc to  antitrust. 
See, e. g., Verizon Communications Inc. v.  Law Ofﬁces of 
Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U. S. 398, 406 (2004) (“ ‘[N]othing 
in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall be 
construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of 
1 The Court suggests that the argument advanced in my opinion was 
not preserved by respondents.  See ante, at 275.  Respondents’ principal 
contention in the Court of Appeals below was that “[t]he federal securities 
laws do not expressly immunize Defendants’ alleged conduct from prosecu­
tion under the federal antitrust laws.”  See, e. g., Brief for Appellants in 
No. 03–9288 (CA2), pp. 15–16.  Because a full reading of the securities 
laws is essential to analyzing respondents’ central argument, I do not con­
sider arguments based on the saving clauses unpreserved.  Cf. United 
States v.  Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984) (“[W]e read statutes as a 
whole”).

any of the antitrust laws’ ” (quoting Telecommunications Act 
of 1996, § 601(b)(1), 110 Stat. 143, note following 47 U. S. C. 
§ 152)).  But the mere existence of targeted saving clauses 
does not demonstrate—or even suggest—that antitrust rem­
edies are not included within the “any and all” other reme­
dies to which the securities saving clauses refer.  Although 
Congress may have singled out antitrust remedies for special 
treatment in some statutes, it is not precluded from using 
more general saving provisions that encompass antitrust and 
other remedies.  Surely Congress is not required to enumer­
ate every cause of action—state and federal—that may be 
brought.  When Congress wants to preserve all other reme­
dies, using the word “all” is sufﬁcient. 
Petitioners also argue that the saving clauses should not 
apply because the clauses did not play a role in the Court’s 
prior securities-antitrust pre-emption cases.  Brief for Peti­
tioners 33, n. 5 (“[N]either provision was found to bar immu­
nity in Gordon [v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc., 422 U. S. 
659 (1975),] or [United States v. National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers, Inc., 422 U. S. 694 (1975) (NASD)]”).  Be that as it 
may, none of the opinions in Silver v. New York Stock Ex­
change, 373 U. S. 341 (1963), Gordon, or NASD—majority or 
dissent—offered any analysis of the saving clauses.  Omit­
ted reasoning has little claim to precedential value.  Absent 
any indication that these omissions were the product of rea­
soned analysis instead of inadvertent oversight, I would not 
allow the Court’s prior silence on this issue to erect a perpet­
ual bar to arguments based on a full reading of the statute’s 
relevant text. 
Finally, it might be argued that the saving clauses pre­
serve only state-law rights and remedies.  This argument 
has no textual basis.  If Congress had intended to limit the 
clauses to state law, it surely would not have phrased them 
to preserve “any and all” rights and remedies.  Other pro­
visions in both Acts, including a later sentence in the sec­
tion containing the Securities Exchange Act’s saving clause,

Thomas, J., dissenting 
suggest that Congress explicitly referred to States when it 
intended  to  impose  a  state-law  limitation.  See,  e. g.,  15 
U. S. C. § 77v(a) (referring to “State and Territorial courts”); 
§ 78bb(a) (referring to the “securities commission . . . of any 
State”); cf. 17 U. S. C. § 301(b) (“Nothing in this title annuls 
or limits any rights or remedies under the common law or 
statutes of any State . . . ”).  Given Congress’ demonstrated 
ability to limit provisions of the securities laws to States and 
the lack of any such limitation here, the saving clauses can­
not be understood as limited only to state-law rights and 
remedies.2 
A straightforward application of the saving clauses to this 
case leads to the conclusion that respondents’ antitrust suits 
must proceed.  Accordingly, we do not need to reconcile any 
conﬂict between the securities laws and the antitrust laws. 
I respectfully dissent. 
2 The Court’s suggestion that the clauses were intended to save only 
securities-related rights and remedies is subject to many of the same criti­
cisms.  See ante, at 275.  The Securities Act of 1933 provided no private 
federal remedy for fraud in the purchase or sale of registered securities. 
On the Court’s proposed reading of § 77p, however, a federal action for 
mail  or  wire  fraud  and  a  state-law  action  for  fraud,  which  are  not 
securities-related rights or remedies, would not have been included within 
the Securities Act’s saving provision.
