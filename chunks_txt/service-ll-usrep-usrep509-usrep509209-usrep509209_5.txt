Opinion of the Court
386  U. S.  685 (1967).  In  Utah Pie, we reviewed  the suffi-
ciency of the evidence supporting jury verdicts against three
national pie companies that had engaged in a variety of pred-
atory practices  in  the market  for frozen  pies  in Salt Lake
City, with the intent to drive a local pie manufacturer out of
business.  We reversed the Court of Appeals and held that
the evidence presented was adequate to permit a jury to find
a likelihood of injury to competition.  Id., at 703.
Utah Pie has often been interpreted to permit liability for
primary-line price discrimination on a mere showing that the
defendant  intended to harm  competition  or produced  a de-
clining price structure.  The case has been criticized on the
ground that such low standards of competitive injury are at
odds  with  the  antitrust  laws'  traditional  concern  for  con-
sumer  welfare  and  price  competition.  See  Bowman,  Re-
straint of Trade by the Supreme  Court: The Utah Pie Case,
77 Yale  L. J. 70 (1967);  R. Posner, Antitrust Law:  An Eco-
nomic Perspective 193-194 (1976);  L. Sullivan, Antitrust 687
(1977); 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law  720c (1978)
(hereinafter Areeda & Turner); R. Bork, The Antitrust Para-
dox 386-387  (1978);  H. Hovenkamp,  Economics and Federal
Antitrust Law 188-189 (1985).  We do not regard the  Utah
Pie case  itself as having the full  significance  attributed to
it by its detractors.  Utah Pie was an early judicial inquiry
in this  area and did  not purport to set forth  explicit, gen-
eral standards for establishing a violation of the Robinson-
Patman Act.  As the law has been explored  since Utah Pie,
it has become evident that primary-line  competitive  injury
under the Robinson-Patman Act is of the same general char-
acter as the injury  inflicted  by predatory  pricing schemes
actionable under § 2 of the Sherman Act.  See, e. g., Henry v.
Chloride, Inc., 809 F. 2d 1334, 1345 (CA8 1987); D. E. Rogers
Associates, Inc. v. Gardner-Denver Co., 718 F. 2d 1431, 1439
(CA6 1983), cert. denied, 467 U. S.  1242 (1984);  William In-
glis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 668

TOBACCO CORP.
Opinion of the Court
Malcolm v. Marathon Oil Co., 642 F. 2d 845, 853, n. 16 (CA5),
cert. denied,  454  U. S.  1125  (1981);  Pacific Engineering &

tional Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 104 F. T. C. 280,401-402
(1984); Hovenkamp, supra, at 189; 3 Areeda & Turner  720c;
P. Areeda  & H.  Hovenkamp,  Antitrust  Law  720c  (Supp.
1992) (hereinafter Areeda & Hovenkamp).  There are, to be
sure, differences  between  the  two statutes.  For example,
we interpret  § 2 of the Sherman Act to condemn  predatory
pricing when it poses "a dangerous probability of actual mo-
nopolization,"  Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U. S.
447, 455 (1993),  whereas the Robinson-Patman  Act requires
only  that  there  be  "a  reasonable  possibility"  of  substan-
tial  injury  to  competition  before  its  protections  are  trig-
gered,  Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc.,
460 U. S. 428, 434 (1983).  But whatever additional flexibility
the Robinson-Patman  Act standard  may imply, the essence
of the claim  under either  statute is  the same:  A business
rival  has priced, its  products  in an  unfair manner  with an
object to eliminate  or retard competition  and  thereby gain
and exercise control over prices in the relevant market.
Accordingly, whether the claim alleges  predatory pricing
under § 2 of the Sherman Act or primary-line price discrimi-
nation under the Robinson-Patman Act, two prerequisites to
recovery  remain the same.  First, a plaintiff seeking to es-
tablish competitive injury resulting from a rival's low prices
must prove that the prices complained of are below an appro-
priate measure  of its rival's costs.1  See, e. g.,  Cargill, Inc.
v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S.  104, 117 (1986); Mat-
1 Because the parties in this case agree that the relevant measure of cost
is average variable cost, however, we again decline to resolve the conflict
among the lower courts over the appropriate measure of cost.  See Car-
gill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S. 104, 117-118, n. 12 (1986);
Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 585,
n. 8 (1986).

sushita Elec. IndustrialC  o. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S.
574, 585, n. 8 (1986);  Utah Pie, 386 U. S., at 698, 701, 702-703,
n. 14; In re E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 96 F. T. C. 653,
749 (1980).  Cf. United States v. National Dairy Products
Corp., 372 U. S. 29 (1963)  (holding that below-cost prices may
constitute "unreasonably  low"  prices  for purposes  of § 3  of
the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 13a).  Although Car-
gill and Matsushita reserved  as a formal matter the ques-
tion "'whether  recovery  should ever be available  ...  when
the pricing in question is above some measure of incremental
cost,"' Cargill,s upra, at 117-118, n. 12 (quoting Matsushita,
supra, at 585, n. 9), the reasoning in both opinions suggests
that only below-cost prices  should suffice,  and we have re-
jected  elsewhere  the notion that above-cost prices that are
below general market levels or the costs of a firm's competi-
tors inflict injury to competition  cognizable  under the anti-
trust laws.  See Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA  Petroleum
Co., 495 U. S. 328, 340  (1990).  "Low prices benefit consum-
ers regardless  of how  those prices are  set, and  so long  as
they  are  above  predatory  levels,  they  do  not  threaten
competition....  We have adhered to this principle regardless
of the type of antitrust claim involved."  Ibid.  As a general
rule, the exclusionary effect of prices above a relevant meas-
ure  of cost  either reflects  the lower  cost  structure  of the
alleged predator, and so represents  competition on the mer-
its, or is beyond the practical ability of a judicial tribunal to
control  without courting intolerable  risks of chilling legiti-
mate  price  cutting.  See  Areeda  & Hovenkamp  714.2,
714.3.  "To  hold that the antitrust laws protect competitors
from the loss of profits due to such price competition would,
in effect, render illegal any decision by a firm to cut prices
in order to increase  market share.  The  antitrust  laws re-
quire no such perverse result."  Cargill,s upra, at 116.
Even  in  an  oligopolistic  market,  when  a firm  drops  its
prices to a competitive  level  to demonstrate  to a maverick
the unprofitability  of straying from the group, it would  be
