34  ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v. INDEPENDENT INK, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
gress endorsed Chief Justice White’s disapproval of tying ar­
rangements, enacting § 3 of the Clayton Act.  See 38 Stat. 
731 (applying to “patented or unpatented” products); see also 
Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 
U. S. 502, 517–518 (1917) (explaining that, in light of § 3 of 
the  Clayton  Act,  A.  B.  Dick  “must  be  regarded  as  over­
ruled”).  And in this Court’s subsequent cases reviewing the 
legality of tying arrangements we, too, embraced Chief Jus­
tice White’s disapproval of those arrangements.  See, e. g., 
Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 337 U. S. 293, 305– 
306 (1949); Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., 
320 U. S. 661, 664–665 (1944). 
In the years since A. B. Dick, four different rules of law 
have  supported  challenges  to  tying  arrangements.  They 
have been condemned as improper extensions of the patent 
monopoly under the patent misuse doctrine, as unfair meth­
ods of competition under § 5 of the Federal Trade Commis­
sion Act, 15 U. S. C. § 45, as contracts tending to create a 
monopoly under § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 14, and 
as contracts in restraint of trade under § 1 of the Sherman 
Act.2  In all of those instances, the justiﬁcation for the chal­
lenge rested on either an assumption or a showing that the 
defendant’s position of power in the market for the tying 
product was being used to restrain competition in the market 
for the tied product.  As we explained in Jefferson Parish, 
466 U. S., at 12, “[o]ur cases have concluded that the essential 
characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the sell­
er’s exploitation of its control over the tying product to force 
the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer

(1942) (patent misuse); Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. 
Co., 243 U. S. 502, 516 (1917) (same).

Opinion of the Court 
either did not want at all, or might have preferred to pur­
chase elsewhere on different terms.” 
Over the years, however, this Court’s strong disapproval 
of tying arrangements has substantially diminished. 
Rather than relying on assumptions, in its more recent opin­
ions the Court has required a showing of market power in 
the tying product.  Our early opinions consistently assumed 
that “[t]ying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond 
the  suppression  of  competition.”  Standard  Oil  Co.,  337 
U. S., at 305–306.  In 1962, in Loew’s, 371 U. S., at 47–48, the 
Court relied on this assumption despite evidence of signiﬁ­
cant competition in the market for the tying product.  And 
as recently as 1969, Justice Black, writing for the majority, 
relied on the assumption as support for the proposition “that, 
at least when certain prerequisites are met, arrangements of 
this kind are illegal in and of themselves, and no speciﬁc 
showing  of  unreasonable  competitive  effect  is  required.” 
Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 
U. S. 495, 498–499 (Fortner I).  Explaining the Court’s deci­
sion to allow the suit to proceed to trial, he stated that “deci­
sions rejecting the need for proof of truly dominant power 
over the tying product have all been based on a recognition 
that because tying arrangements generally serve no legiti­
mate business purpose that cannot be achieved in some less 
restrictive way, the presence of any appreciable restraint on 
competition provides a sufﬁcient reason for invalidating the 
tie.”  Id., at 503. 
Reﬂecting a changing view of tying arrangements, four 
Justices dissented in Fortner I, arguing that the challenged 
“tie”—the extension of a $2 million line of credit on condition 
that the borrower purchase prefabricated houses from the 
defendant—might  well  have  served  a  legitimate  purpose. 
Id., at 510 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 520 (opinion of Fortas, 
J.).  In his opinion, Justice  White noted that promotional 
tie-ins may provide “uniquely advantageous deals” to pur­
chasers.  Id., at 519.  And Justice Fortas concluded that the

Opinion of the Court 
arrangement was best characterized as “a sale of a single 
product  with  the  incidental  provision  of  ﬁnancing.”  Id., 
at 522. 
The dissenters’ view that tying arrangements may well be 
procompetitive ultimately prevailed; indeed, it did so in the 
very same lawsuit.  After the Court remanded the suit in 
Fortner I, a bench trial resulted in judgment for the plaintiff, 
and the case eventually made its way back to this Court. 
Upon return, we unanimously held that the plaintiff’s failure 
of proof on the issue of market power was fatal to its case— 
the plaintiff had proved “nothing more than a willingness to 
provide cheap ﬁnancing in order to sell expensive houses.” 
United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 
U. S. 610, 622 (1977) (Fortner II). 
The assumption that “[t]ying arrangements serve hardly 
any  purpose  beyond  the  suppression  of  competition,”  re­
jected in Fortner II, has not been endorsed in any opinion 
since.  Instead, it was again rejected just seven years later 
in Jefferson Parish, where, as in Fortner II, we unanimously 
reversed a Court of Appeals judgment holding that an al­
leged tying arrangement constituted a per se violation of § 1 
of the Sherman Act.  466 U. S., at 5.  Like the product at 
issue in the Fortner cases, the tying product in Jefferson 
Parish—hospital services—was unpatented, and our holding 
again rested on the conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to 
prove sufﬁcient power in the tying product market to re­
strain competition in the market for the tied product—serv­
ices of anesthesiologists.  466 U. S., at 28–29. 
In rejecting the application of a per se rule that all tying 
arrangements constitute antitrust violations, we explained: 
“[W]e have condemned tying arrangements when the 
seller has some special ability—usually called ‘market 
power’—to force a purchaser to do something that he 
would not do in a competitive market. . . .
