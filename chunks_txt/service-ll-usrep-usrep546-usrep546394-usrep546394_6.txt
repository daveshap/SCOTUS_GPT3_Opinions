Stevens, J., dissenting 
For the reasons articulated by the Court in Cone, 330 U. S., 
at 216, it may be unfair or even an abuse of discretion for a 
court of appeals to direct a verdict in favor of the party that 
lost below if that party failed to make a timely Rule 50(b) 
motion.  Likewise, it may not be “just under the circum­
stances” for a court of appeals to order a new trial in the 
absence of a proper Rule 59 motion.  Finally, a court of ap­
peals has discretion to rebuff, on grounds of waiver or forfeit­
ure, a challenge to the sufﬁciency of the evidence absent a 
proper Rule 50(b) or Rule 59 motion made in the district 
court.  None of the foregoing propositions rests, however, 
on a determination that the courts of appeals lack “power” 
to review the sufﬁciency of the evidence and order appro­
priate relief under these circumstances, and I can divine no 
basis for that determination. 
I respectfully dissent. 
First, although the right to trial by jury might be implicated if no Rule 
50(a) motion had been made, such a motion was made in this case.  The 
Rule 50(a) motion triggered the automatic reservation of “legal questions,” 
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b), and that reservation, in turn, averted any Sev­
enth Amendment problem, see Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Red­
man, 295 U. S. 654 (1935).  Second, the Seventh Amendment imposes no 
greater restriction on appellate courts than it does on district courts in 
these circumstances; “[a]s far as the Seventh Amendment’s right to jury 
trial is concerned, there is no greater restriction on the province of the 
jury when an appellate court enters judgment n. o. v. than when a trial 
court does.”  Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co., 386 U. S. 317, 322 (1967).
