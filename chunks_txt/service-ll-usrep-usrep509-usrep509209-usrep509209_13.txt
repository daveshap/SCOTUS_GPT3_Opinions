The fact that a price war may not have accomplished  its
purpose  as quickly or as  completely  as originally  intended
does not immunize conduct that was illegal when it occurred.
A  proper understanding  of this  case  therefore  requires  a
brief description  of the situation  before  the war began  in
July  1984;  the events  that occurred  during the period  be-
tween July  1984  and the end of 1985;  and, finally, the facts
bearing on the predictability of competitive harm during or
at the end of that period.3
Background
B&W  is the  third largest  firm  in  a highly  concentrated
industry.  Ante, at 213.  For decades, the industry has been
marked by the same kind of supracompetitive pricing that is
characteristic  of the textbook monopoly.4  Without  the ne-
cessity of actual agreement among the six major manufactur-
ers, "prices for cigarettes increased in lockstep, twice a year,
for a number of years, irrespective  of the rate of inflation,
changes in the costs of production, or shifts in consumer de-
mand."  Ibid.  Notwithstanding  the  controversy  over  the
health effects of smoking and the increase in the federal ex-
cise tax, profit margins improved "handsomely" during the
period between 1972 and 1983.6
8 As the majority notes, the procedural posture of this case requires that
we view the evidence in the light most favorable  to Liggett.  Ante, at
213.  On review  of a judgment notwithstanding  the  verdict, the party
against whom the judgment is entered "must be given the benefit of every
legitimate  inference  that  can  be  drawn  from  the  evidence."  See  C.
Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง2528, pp. 563-564
(1971).
4When the Court states that "[s]ubstantial  evidence  suggests that in
recent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competi-
tive level," ante, at 213, I assume it accepts the proposition that a reason-
able jury could find abnormally high prices characteristic of this industry.
' An internal B&W memorandum, dated May 15,  1984, states in part:
"Manufacturer's price increases generally were below the rate of infla-
tion but margins improved handsomely due to favorable  leaf prices and

TOBACCO CORP.

The early 1980's brought two new developments to the cig-
arette market.  First, in 1980, when its share of the market
had declined  to 2.3%,  Liggett introduced  a new line of ge-
neric cigarettes in plain black and white packages, offered at
an effective  price of approximately  30% less  than branded
cigarettes.  Ante, at 214.  A B&W memorandum described
this action as "the first time that a [cigarette] manufacturer
has used pricing as a strategic marketing weapon in the U. S.
since  the  depression  era."  App.  128.  This  novel  tactic
proved successful; by 1984, Liggett's black and whites repre-
sented about 4% of the total market and generated substan-
tial profits.  The next development came in 1984, when R. J.
Reynolds (RJR), the second largest company in the industry,
"repositioned" one of its established brands, Doral, by selling
it  at  discount  prices  comparable  to  Liggett's  black  and
whites.  App. 117-118; ante, at 215.
B&W  executives  prepared  a  number  of internal  memo-
randa planning responses to these two market developments.
See  App.  120,  127,  157,  166.  With respect  to RJR,  B&W
decided to "follo[w]  precisely the pathway" of that company,
id., at 121, reasoning that "introduction of a branded generic
by B&W now appears  to be feasible  as  RJR has  the clout
and  sales force coverage  to maintain the price  on branded
generics,"  id., at 145.  Accordingly, B&W planned to intro-
duce  a new "branded  generic"  of its  own,  known as  Hall-
mark, to be sold at the same prices as RJR's Doral.  Id., at
124, 142-144.
cost reductions associated with automation.  For example, Brown & Wil-
liamson's variable  margin increased from $2.91/M  in 1972 to $8.78/M  in
1981, an increase of over 200%.  In 1982, the industry became much more
aggressive  on the pricing front, fueled by a 100% increase in the Federal
Excise  Tax.  Brown  & Williamson's  variable  margin  increased  from
$10.78/M  in 1982 and [sic] to $12.61/M  in 1983.
"The impact of these pricing activities on the smoking public was dra-
matic.  The weighted average retail price of a pack of cigarettes increased
56% between 1980 and 1983 (from $.63 to $.98)."  App. 127.

B&W took a more aggressive approach to Liggett's black
and  whites.  It decided to launch  its own line of black and
white cigarettes  with the "[s]ame  style array" and list price
as  Liggett's,  but  with  "[sluperior  discounts/allowances."
Id., at 124.  B&W estimated  that its own black and whites
would generate a "trading profit" of $5.1 million for the sec-
ond half of 1984 and $43.6 million for 1985.  Id., at 125.  At
the  same  time,  however,  B&W, anticipating  "competitive
counterattacks,"  was  "prepared  to redistribute  this  entire
amount in the form  of additional  trade allowances."  Ibid.
B&W's competitive stance was confined to Liggett; the mem-
orandum  outlining  B&W's  plans  made no  reference  to the
possibility of countermoves by RJR, or to the use of B&W's
trading profits to increase  allowances  on any product other
than black and whites.
.This "dual approach" was designed to "provide B&W more
influence  to manage up the prices of branded generics to im-
prove profitability,"  id., at 123,  and also the opportunity  to
participate  in  the  economy  market,  with  a  view  toward
"manag[ing]  down  generic  volume,"  id., at  109.  Notwith-
standing its ultimate aim to "limit generic segment growth,"
id., at 113,  B&W estimated  an aggregate  potential  trading
profit on black and  whites of $342  million for 1984 to 1988,
id., at 146.  Though  B&W  recognized that it might be re-
quired to use "some or all of this potential trading profit" to
maintain  its market position, it also believed  that it would
recoup  its losses  as  the segment became  "more profitable,
particularly as it approaches maturity."  Ibid.
B&W began to implement its plan even before it made its
first shipment of black and whites in July 1984, with a series
of price  announcements  in June of that year.  When  B&W
announced its first volume discount schedule for distributors,
Liggett responded by increasing its own discounts.  Though
Liggett's  discounts  remained  lower than  B&W's,  B&W  re-
sponded  in  turn  by  increasing  its  rebates  still  further.
After four or five moves and countermoves, the dust settled
