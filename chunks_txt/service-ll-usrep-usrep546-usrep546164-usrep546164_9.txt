188  VOLVO TRUCKS NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. REEDER-
SIMCO GMC, INC. 
Stevens, J., dissenting 
prices were employed as means of escaping contractual com­
mitments and eliminating speciﬁcally targeted ﬁrms from a 
competitive  market.  The  exceptional  quality  of  this  case 
provides  strong  reason  to  enforce  the  Act’s  prohibition 
against discrimination even if Judge Bork’s evaluation (with 
which I happen to agree) is completely accurate. 
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
