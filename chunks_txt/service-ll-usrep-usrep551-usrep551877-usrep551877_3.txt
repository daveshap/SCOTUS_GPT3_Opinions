Opinion of the Court 
Kay’s Kloset became the destination retailer in the area to 
buy Brighton products.  Brighton was the store’s most im­
portant brand and once accounted for 40 to 50 percent of 
its proﬁts. 
In 1997, Leegin instituted the “Brighton Retail Pricing 
and Promotion Policy.”  4 id., at 939.  Following the policy, 
Leegin refused to sell to retailers that discounted Brighton 
goods below suggested prices.  The policy contained an ex­
ception for products not selling well that the retailer did not 
plan on reordering.  In the letter to retailers establishing 
the policy, Leegin stated: 
“In this age of mega stores like Macy’s, Bloomingdales, 
May Co. and others, consumers are perplexed by prom­
ises of product quality and support of product which we 
believe is lacking in these large stores.  Consumers are 
further confused by the ever popular sale, sale, sale, etc. 
“We, at Leegin, choose to break away from the pack 
by selling [at] specialty stores; specialty stores that can 
offer  the  customer  great quality  merchandise,  superb 
service, and support the Brighton product 365 days a 
year on a consistent basis. 
“We realize that half the equation is Leegin producing 
great Brighton product and the other half is you, our 
retailer, creating great looking stores selling our prod­
ucts in a quality manner.”  Ibid. 
Leegin adopted the policy to give its retailers sufﬁcient mar­
gins to provide customers the service central to its distribu­
tion strategy.  It also expressed concern that discounting 
harmed Brighton’s brand image and reputation. 
A year after instituting the pricing policy Leegin intro­
duced a marketing strategy known as the “Heart Store Pro­
gram.”  See id., at 962–972.  It offered retailers incentives 
to become Heart Stores, and, in exchange, retailers pledged, 
among  other  things,  to  sell  at  Leegin’s  suggested  prices. 
Kay’s Kloset became a Heart Store soon after Leegin created

Opinion of the Court 
the program.  After a Leegin employee visited the store 
and found it unattractive, the parties appear to have agreed 
that Kay’s Kloset would not be a Heart Store beyond 1998. 
Despite losing this status, Kay’s Kloset continued to increase 
its Brighton sales. 
In December 2002, Leegin discovered Kay’s Kloset had 
been  marking  down  Brighton’s  entire  line  by  20  percent. 
Kay’s Kloset contended it placed Brighton products on sale 
to compete with nearby retailers who also were undercutting 
Leegin’s suggested prices.  Leegin, nonetheless, requested 
that Kay’s Kloset cease discounting.  Its request refused, 
Leegin stopped selling to the store.  The loss of the Brigh­
ton brand had a considerable negative impact on the store’s 
revenue from sales. 
PSKS sued Leegin in the United States District Court for 
the  Eastern  District  of  Texas.  It  alleged,  among  other 
claims, that Leegin had violated the antitrust laws by “enter­
[ing]  into  agreements  with  retailers  to  charge  only  those 
prices ﬁxed by Leegin.”  Id., at 1236.  Leegin planned to 
introduce expert testimony describing the procompetitive ef­
fects of its pricing policy.  The District Court excluded the 
testimony,  relying  on  the  per  se  rule  established  by  Dr. 
Miles.  At trial PSKS argued that the Heart Store program, 
among other things, demonstrated Leegin and its retailers 
had agreed to ﬁx prices.  Leegin responded that it had es­
tablished a unilateral pricing policy lawful under § 1, which 
applies only to concerted action.  See United States v. Col­
gate & Co., 250 U. S. 300, 307 (1919).  The jury agreed with 
PSKS and awarded it $1.2 million.  Pursuant to 15 U. S. C. 
§ 15(a), the District Court trebled the damages and reim­
bursed PSKS for its attorney’s fees and costs.  It entered 
judgment against Leegin in the amount of $3,975,000.80. 
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit afﬁrmed.  171 
Fed. Appx. 464 (2006) (per curiam).  On appeal Leegin did 
not  dispute  that  it  had  entered  into  vertical  price-ﬁxing 
agreements with its retailers.  Rather, it contended that the

Opinion of the Court 
rule  of  reason  should  have  applied  to  those  agreements. 
The Court of Appeals rejected this argument.  Id., at 466– 
467.  It was correct to explain that it remained bound by 
Dr. Miles “[b]ecause [the Supreme] Court has consistently 
applied the  per se  rule to [vertical  minimum price-ﬁxing] 
agreements.”  171 Fed. Appx., at 466.  On this premise the 
Court of Appeals held that the District Court did not abuse 
its  discretion  in  excluding  the  testimony  of  Leegin’s  eco­
nomic expert, for the per se rule rendered irrelevant any 
procompetitive justiﬁcations for Leegin’s pricing policy.  Id., 
at 467.  We granted certiorari to determine whether verti­
cal minimum resale price maintenance agreements should 
continue to be treated as per se unlawful.  549 U. S. 1092 
(2006). 
II 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits “[e]very contract, 
combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.” 
Ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 1.  While § 1 
could  be  interpreted  to  proscribe  all  contracts,  see,  e. g., 
Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S. 231, 
238 (1918), the Court has never “taken a literal approach to 
[its] language,” Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U. S. 1, 5 (2006). 
Rather, the Court has repeated time and again that § 1 “out­
law[s] only unreasonable restraints.”  State Oil Co. v. Khan, 
522 U. S. 3, 10 (1997). 
The rule of reason is the accepted standard for testing 
whether a practice restrains trade in violation of § 1.  See 
Texaco, supra, at 5.  “Under this rule, the factﬁnder weighs 
all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a re­
strictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unrea­
sonable restraint on competition.”  Continental T. V., Inc. 
v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 49 (1977).  Appropriate 
factors  to  take  into  account  include  “speciﬁc  information 
about the relevant business” and “the restraint’s history, na­
ture, and effect.”  Khan, supra, at 10.  Whether the busi­
