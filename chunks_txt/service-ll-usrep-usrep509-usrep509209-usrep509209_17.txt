tition is likely to ensue.17   None  of our cases  disputes that
proposition.
Also  as  a matter of economics,  the Court  insists that a
predatory pricing program in an oligopoly is unlikely to suc-
ceed  absent  actual  conspiracy.  Though  it has  rejected  a
somewhat  stronger version of this proposition as  a rule of
decision, see ante, at 229-230, the Court comes back to the
same economic theory, relying on the supposition that an "an-
ticompetitive minuet is most difficult to compose and to per-
form,  even  for a disciplined  oligopoly,"  ante, at 228.  See
ante, at 238-243  (implausibility  of tacit coordination among
cigarette oligopolists in 1980's).  I would suppose, however,
that the professional performers who had danced the minuet
for 40 to 50 years  would be better able to predict whether
their favorite partners would follow them in the future than
would an  outsider, who might not know the difference  be-
tween  Haydn  and  Mozart."  In  any  event,  the  jury was

258  BROOKE GROUP LTD. v. BROWN & WILLIAMSON
TOBACCO CORP.
STEVENS, J., dissenting
surely entitled to infer that at the time of the price war itself,
B&W reasonably believed  that it could signal its intentions
to its fellow oligopolists, see App. 61,  assuring their contin-
ued cooperation.
Perhaps the Court's most significant error is the assump-
tion that seems to pervade much of the final sections  of its
opinion:  that Liggett had the burden of proving either the
actuality of supracompetitive pricing, or the actuality of tacit
collusion.  See ante, at 233-237  (finding absence  of actual
supracompetitive  pricing),  238-243  (finding  absence  of evi-
dence  suggesting actual  coordination).  In  my opinion, the
jury was  entitled  to infer from  the succession  of price  in-
creases after 1985-when the prices for branded and generic
cigarettes increased every six months from $33.15 and $19.75,
respectively,  to $46.15  and  $33.75-that B&W's  below-cost
pricing actually produced  supracompetitive  prices, with the
help of tacit collusion among the players.  See supra, at 255.
But even if that were not so clear, the jury would surely be
entitled  to  infer  that  B&W's  predatory  plan,  in  which  it
invested  millions of dollars for the purpose  of achieving an
admittedly  anticompetitive  result,  carried  a  "reasonable
possibility" of injuring competition.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
