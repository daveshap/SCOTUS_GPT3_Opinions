38  DASTAR  CORP. v. TWENTIETH  CENTURY  FOX
FILM  CORP.
Opinion of the Court
ยง 103(a).  Had  Fox  renewed  the copyright  in  the  Crusade
television  series,  it  would  have  had  an  easy  claim  of
copyright infringement.  And  respondents' contention  that
Campaigns  infringes  Doubleday's  copyright  in  General  Ei-
senhower's  book  is  still  a  live  question  on  remand.  If,
moreover, the producer of a video that substantially copied
the Crusade series were, in advertising or promotion, to give
purchasers  the impression that the video was quite different
from that series, then one or more of the respondents might
have a cause of action-not for reverse passing off under the
"confusion...  as to the origin" provision of ยง 43(a)(1)(A), but
for misrepresentation  under the "misrepresents the nature,
characteristics [or]  qualities" provision of ยง 43(a)(1)(B).  For
merely saying it is the producer  of the video, however, no
Lanham Act liability attaches to Dastar.
Because we conclude that Dastar was the "origin" of the
products it  sold as its own,  respondents  cannot  prevail  on
their Lanham Act claim.  We thus have no occasion to con-
sider whether the Lanham Act permitted an award of double
petitioner's profits.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings  consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or deci-
sion of this case.
