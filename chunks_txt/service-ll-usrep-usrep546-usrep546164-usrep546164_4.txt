Opinion of the Court 
tistical analysis whether Reeder was disfavored on average 
as  compared  to  another  dealer  or  set  of  dealers.  Id.,  at 
1462–1464. 
The jury found that there was a reasonable possibility that 
discriminatory  pricing  may  have  harmed  competition  be­
tween Reeder and other Volvo truck dealers, and that Vol­
vo’s discriminatory pricing injured Reeder.  App. 480–486. 
It further found that Reeder’s damages from Volvo’s 
Robinson-Patman Act violation exceeded $1.3 million.  Id., 
at 486.2  The District Court summarily denied Volvo’s mo­
tion for judgment as a matter of law and the company’s alter­
native  motion for  new  trial or  remittitur, awarded  treble 
damages  on  the  Robinson-Patman Act  claim,  and  entered 
judgment. 
A  divided  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eighth  Circuit  af­
ﬁrmed.  The appeals court noted that, “as a threshold mat­
ter[,] Reeder had to show [that] it was a ‘purchaser’ within 
the meaning of the [Act],” 374 F. 3d, at 708, i. e., that “there 
were actual sales at two different prices[,] . . . a sale to 
[Reeder] and a sale to another Volvo dealer,” id., at 707–708. 
Rejecting Volvo’s contention that competitive bidding situa­
tions do not give rise to claims under the Robinson-Patman 
Act,  id.,  at  708–709,  the  Court  of  Appeals  observed  that 
Reeder was “more than an unsuccessful bidder,” id., at 709. 
The  four  instances  in  which  Reeder  “actually  purchased 
Volvo  trucks  following  successful  bids  on  contracts,”  the 
court  concluded,  sufﬁced  to  render  Reeder  a  purchaser 
within the meaning of the Act.  Ibid. 
The Court of Appeals next determined that a jury could 
reasonably decide that Reeder was “in actual competition” 
with  favored  dealers.  Ibid.  “[A]s  of  the  time  the  price 
differential was imposed,” the court reasoned, “the favored 
2The jury also awarded Reeder damages of $513,750 on Reeder’s state­
law claim under the Arkansas Franchise Practices Act.  No question is 
before us respecting that claim, which trained on Volvo’s alleged design to 
eliminate Reeder as a Volvo dealer.  See supra, at 171.

Opinion of the Court 
and disfavored purchasers competed at the same functional 
level . . . and w  ithin  the  same geographic market.”  Ibid. 
(quoting  Best  Brands  Beverage,  Inc.  v.  Falstaff  Brewing 
Corp.,  842 F. 2d 578, 585 (CA2 1987)).  The court further 
held that the jury could properly ﬁnd from the evidence that 
Reeder had proved competitive injury from price discrimina­
tion.  Speciﬁcally,  the  court  pointed  to  evidence  showing 
that (1) Volvo intended to reduce the number of its dealers; 
(2) Reeder lost the Hiland Dairy contract, for which it com­
peted head to head with another Volvo dealer; (3) Reeder 
would have earned more proﬁts, had it received the conces­
sions other dealers received; and (4) Reeder’s sales had de­
clined over a period of time.  374 F. 3d, at 711–712.  The 
court also afﬁrmed the award of treble damages to Reeder. 
Id., at 712–714. 
Judge Hansen dissented as to the Robinson-Patman Act 
claim.  “Traditional [Robinson-Patman Act] cases,” he ob­
served, “involve sellers and purchasers that carry inventory 
or deal in fungible goods.”  Id., at 718.  The majority, Judge 
Hansen commented, “attempt[ed] to ﬁt a square peg into a 
round hole,” ibid., when it extended the Act’s reach to the 
marketplace  for  heavy-duty  trucks,  where  “special-order 
products are sold to individual, pre-identiﬁed customers only 
after competitive bidding,” ibid.  There may be competition 
among dealers for the opportunity to bid on potential sales, 
he noted, but “[o]nce bidding begins, . . . the relevant market 
becomes limited to the needs and demands of a particular 
end user, with only a handful of dealers competing for the 
ultimate sale.”  Id., at 719.  Violation of the Act, in Judge 
Hansen’s  view,  could  not  be  predicated  on  the  instances 
Reeder identiﬁed in which it was a purchaser, for “there was 
no actual competition between” Reeder and another Volvo 
dealer at the time of Reeder’s purchases.  Ibid.  “Without 
proof of actual competition” for the same customer when the 
requisite purchases were made, he concluded, “Reeder can­

We granted certiorari, 544 U. S. 903 (2005), to resolve this 
question: May a manufacturer be held liable for secondary­
line price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act in 
the absence of a showing that the manufacturer discrimi­
nated between dealers competing to resell its product to the 
same retail customer?  Satisﬁed that the Court of Appeals 
erred in answering that question in the afﬁrmative, we re­
verse the Eighth Circuit’s judgment.

Section 2, “when originally enacted as part of the Clayton 
Act in 1914, was born of a desire by Congress to curb the use 
by ﬁnancially powerful corporations of localized price-cutting 
tactics which had gravely impaired the competitive position 
of other sellers.”  FTC v.  Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U. S. 
536, 543, and n. 6 (1960) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 
2d  Sess.,  8  (1914);  S.  Rep.  No.  698,  63d  Cong.,  2d  Sess., 
2–4 (1914)).  Augmenting that provision in 1936 with the 
Robinson-Patman Act, Congress sought to target the per­
ceived harm to competition occasioned by powerful buyers, 
rather than sellers; speciﬁcally, Congress responded to the 
advent of large chainstores, enterprises with the clout to ob­
tain lower prices for goods than smaller buyers could de­
mand.  See 14 H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 2302, p. 11

Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis ¶ 602, pp. 908–909 (5th ed. 1997) 
(hereinafter Areeda).  The Act provides, in relevant part: 
“It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in com­
merce . . . to discriminate in price between different pur­
chasers of commodities of like grade and quality, . . . 
where the effect of such discrimination may be substan­
tially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly 
in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or know­
