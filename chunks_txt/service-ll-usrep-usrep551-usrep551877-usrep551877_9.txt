Opinion of the Court 
Sherman Act when the Court had little experience with anti­
trust analysis.  Only eight years after Dr. Miles, moreover, 
the Court reined in the decision by holding that a manufac­
turer can announce suggested resale prices and refuse to 
deal with distributors who do not follow them.  Colgate, 250 
U. S., at 307–308. 
In more recent cases the Court, following a common-law 
approach, has continued to temper, limit, or overrule once 
strict prohibitions on vertical restraints.  In 1977, the Court 
overturned the per se rule for vertical nonprice restraints, 
adopting the rule of reason in its stead.  GTE Sylvania, 
433  U. S.,  at  57–59  (overruling  United  States  v.  Arnold, 
Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967)); see also 433 U. S., at 
58, n. 29 (noting “that the advantages of vertical restrictions 
should not be limited to the categories of new entrants and 
failing ﬁrms”).  While the Court in a footnote in GTE Syl­
vania suggested that differences between vertical price and 
nonprice restraints could support different legal treatment, 
see id., at 51, n. 18, the central part of the opinion relied 
on authorities and arguments that ﬁnd unequal treatment 
“difﬁcult to justify,” id., at 69–70 (White, J., concurring in 
judgment). 
Continuing in this direction, in two cases in the 1980’s the 
Court deﬁned legal rules to limit the reach of Dr. Miles and 
to accommodate the doctrines enunciated in GTE Sylvania 
and  Colgate.  See  Business  Electronics,  supra,  at  726– 
728;  Monsanto, 465  U. S.,  at  763–764.  In  Monsanto,  the 
Court required that antitrust plaintiffs alleging a § 1 price­
ﬁxing conspiracy must present evidence tending to exclude 
the possibility a manufacturer and its distributors acted in an 
independent manner.  Id., at 764.  Unlike Justice Brennan’s 
concurrence,  which  rejected  arguments  that  Dr.  Miles 
should be overruled, see 465 U. S., at 769, the Court “de­
cline[d] to reach the question” whether vertical agreements 
ﬁxing resale prices always should be unlawful because nei­
ther party suggested otherwise, id., at 761–762, n. 7.  In

PSKS, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
Business Electronics the Court further narrowed the scope 
of Dr. Miles.  It held that the per se rule applied only to 
speciﬁc agreements over price levels and not to an agree­
ment between a manufacturer and a distributor to terminate 
a price-cutting distributor.  485 U. S., at 726–727, 735–736. 
Most recently, in 1997, after examining the issue of vertical 
maximum  price-ﬁxing  agreements  in  light  of  commentary 
and real experience, the Court overruled a 29-year-old prece­
dent treating those agreements as per se illegal.  Khan, 522 
U. S., at 22 (overruling Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U. S. 145 
(1968)).  It held instead that they should be evaluated under 
the traditional rule of reason.  522 U. S., at 22.  Our contin­
ued limiting of the reach of the decision in Dr. Miles and 
our recent treatment of other vertical restraints justify the 
conclusion that Dr. Miles should not be retained. 
The Dr. Miles rule is also inconsistent with a principled 
framework, for it makes little economic sense when analyzed 
with our other cases on vertical restraints.  If we were to 
decide the procompetitive effects of resale price maintenance 
were insufﬁcient to overrule Dr. Miles, then cases such as 
Colgate and GTE Sylvania themselves would be called into 
question.  These later decisions, while they may result in 
less intrabrand competition, can be justiﬁed because they 
permit manufacturers to secure the procompetitive beneﬁts 
associated with vertical price restraints through other meth­
ods.  The other methods, however, could be less efﬁcient for 
a particular manufacturer to establish and sustain.  The end 
result  hinders  competition  and  consumer  welfare  because 
manufacturers are forced to engage in second-best alterna­
tives and because consumers are required to shoulder the 
increased expense of the inferior practices. 
The manufacturer has a number of legitimate options to 
achieve beneﬁts similar to those provided by vertical price 
restraints.  A manufacturer can exercise its Colgate right to 
refuse to deal with retailers that do not follow its suggested 
prices.  See 250 U. S., at 307.  The economic effects of uni­

Opinion of the Court 
lateral and concerted price setting are in general the same. 
See, e. g., Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 762–764.  The problem for 
the manufacturer is that a jury might conclude its unilateral 
policy was really a vertical agreement, subjecting it to treble 
damages  and  potential  criminal  liability.  Ibid.;  Business 
Electronics, supra, at 728.  Even with the stringent stand­
ards in Monsanto and Business Electronics, this danger can 
lead, and has led, rational manufacturers to take wasteful 
measures.  See, e. g., Brief for PING, Inc., as Amicus Cu­
riae 9–18.  A manufacturer might refuse to discuss its pric­
ing  policy  with  its  distributors  except  through  counsel 
knowledgeable  of  the  subtle  intricacies  of  the  law.  Or  it 
might terminate longstanding distributors for minor viola­
tions without seeking an explanation.  See ibid.  The in­
creased costs these burdensome measures generate ﬂow to 
consumers in the form of higher prices. 
Furthermore, depending on the type of product it sells, a 
manufacturer might be able to achieve the procompetitive 
beneﬁts of resale price maintenance by integrating down­
stream and selling its products directly to consumers.  Dr. 
Miles tilts the relative costs of vertical integration and verti­
cal agreement by making the former more attractive based 
on the per se rule, not on real market conditions.  See Busi­
ness Electronics, supra, at 725; see generally Coase, The Na­
ture of the Firm, 4 Economica, New Series 386 (1937).  This 
distortion might lead to inefﬁcient integration that would not 
otherwise take place, so that consumers must again suffer 
the  consequences  of  the  suboptimal  distribution  strategy. 
And integration, unlike vertical price restraints, eliminates 
all intrabrand competition.  See, e. g., GTE Sylvania, supra, 
at 57, n. 26. 
There is yet another consideration.  A manufacturer can 
impose territorial restrictions on distributors and allow only 
one distributor to sell its goods in a given region.  Our cases 
have recognized, and the economics literature conﬁrms, that 
these vertical nonprice restraints have impacts similar to
