Breyer, J., concurring in judgment 
petitioners were required to provide wholesale digital sub­
scriber line (DSL) transport service as a common carrier, 
charging “just and reasonable” rates that were not “unrea­
sonabl[y]  discriminat[ory].”  47  U. S. C.  §§ 201(b),  202(a) 
(2000 ed.).  And, in my view, a purchaser from a regulated 
ﬁrm (which, if a natural monopolist, is lawfully such) cannot 
win an antitrust case simply by showing that it is “squeezed” 
between the regulated ﬁrm’s wholesale price (to the plain­
tiff) and its retail price (to customers for whose business 
both ﬁrms compete).  When a regulatory structure exists to 
deter and remedy anticompetitive harm, the costs of anti­
trust enforcement are likely to be greater than the beneﬁts. 
See Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F. 2d 17, 26–29 (CA1 
1990).  Cf. 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law ¶¶ 834– 
836, pp. 344–355 (1978) (whether a particular course of con­
duct counts as “exclusionary” for antitrust purposes depends 
upon a host of factors, including, for example, the market 
position of the defendant, the nature of the market, and the 
nature of the defendant’s conduct). 
Unlike Concord, the regulators here controlled prices only 
at the wholesale level.  See 915 F. 2d, at 29.  But respond­
ents do not claim that that regulatory fact makes any differ­
ence; and rightly so, for as far as I can tell, respondents could 
have gone to the regulators and asked for petitioners’ whole­
sale prices to be lowered in light of the alleged price squeeze. 
Cf.  FPC  v.  Conway  Corp.,  426  U. S.  271,  279  (1976);  3 
Areeda & Turner, supra, ¶ 726e, at 219–220. 
Respondents now seek to show only that the defendant 
engaged  in  predatory  pricing,  within  the  terms  of  this 
Court’s decision in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & William­
son Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 209 (1993).  The District Court 
can determine whether there is anything in the procedural 
history of  this case  that bars respondents  from asserting 
their predatory pricing claim.  And if not, it can decide the 
merits of that claim.  As I said, I would remand the case so 
that it can do so.
