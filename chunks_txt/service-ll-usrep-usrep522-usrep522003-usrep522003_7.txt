dition."  National Soc. of ProfessionalE  ngineers v. United
States, 435 U. S. 679, 688 (1978).  As we have explained, the
term "restraint of trade," as used in ยง 1, also "invokes  the
common law itself, and not merely the static content that the
common law had assigned to the term in 1890."  Business
Electronics, 485  U. S.,  at 732; see also GTE Sylvania, 433
U. S., at 53, n. 21; McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350,
372-373  (1987) (STEVENS,  J., dissenting).  Accordingly, this
Court has  reconsidered its decisions  construing  the  Sher-
man Act when the theoretical underpinnings  of those deci-
sions are called into serious question.  See, e. g., Copperweld
Corp., supra, at 777;  GTE Sylvania, supra, at 47-49;  cf.
Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S.1 41, 147 (1940).
Although we do not "lightly assume that the economic re-
alities underlying earlier decisions have changed, or that ear-
lier judicial perceptions of those realities were in error," we
have noted that "different sorts of agreements" may amount
to restraints of trade "in varying times and circumstances,"
and  "lilt would make no  sense  to create  out of the single
term 'restraint of trade' a chronologically schizoid statute, in
which a 'rule of reason' evolves with new circumstances and
new wisdom, but a line of per se illegality remains forever
fixed where it was."  Business Electronics, supra, at 731-
732.  Just as Schwinn was "the subject of continuing contro-
versy and confusion" under the "great weight" of scholarly
criticism, GTE Sylvania, supra, at 47-48, Albrecht has been
widely criticized since its inception.  With the views under-
lying Albrecht eroded by this Court's precedent, there is not
much of that decision to salvage.  See, e. g., Neal v. United
States, 516 U. S.2 84, 295 (1996); Pattersonv . McLean Credit
Union, 491  U. S. 164,  173  (1989);  Rodriguez de  Quijas v.
Shearson/American Express, Inc.,  490  U.S. 477,  480-481
(1989).
Although the rule of Albrecht has been in effect for some
time, the inquiry we must undertake  requires  considering
"'the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional

restraints  in  the  American  economy  today."'  GTE  Syl-
vania, supra, at 53, n. 21 (quoting Schwinn, 388 U. S., at 392
(Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  As
the Court noted in ARCO,  495 U. S., at 336, n. 6, there has
not been another case since Albrecht in which this Court has
"confronted an unadulterated vertical, maximum-price-fixing
arrangement."  Now that we confront Albrecht directly, we
find its conceptual foundations gravely weakened.
In overruling Albrecht, we of course do not hold that all
vertical maximum price fixing is per se lawful.  Instead, ver-
tical maximum price fixing, like the majority of commercial
arrangements  subject-to the antitrust laws, should be evalu-
ated under the rule of -reason.  In our view, rule-of-reason
analysis  will  effectively  identify  those  situations  in which
vertical  maximum  price  fixing amounts  to anticompetitive
conduct.
There remains the question whether respondents are enti-
tled to recover  damages based on State Oil's  conduct.  Al-
though the Court of Appeals noted that "the district judge
was right to conclude that if the rule of reason is applicable,
Khan loses," 93 F. 3d, at 1362, its consideration of this case
was necessarily premised on Albrech's per se rule.  Under
the circumstances,  the  matter  should be  reviewed  by the
Court of Appeals in the first instance.  We therefore vacate
the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case
for further proceedings  consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
