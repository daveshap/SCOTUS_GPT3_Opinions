duties, privileges, or standards of conduct.  We also note 
(4) that in Gordon and NASD the possible conﬂict affected 
practices that lie squarely within an area of ﬁnancial market 
activity that the securities law seeks to regulate.

These principles, applied to the complaints before us, con­
siderably  narrow  our  legal  task.  For  the  parties  cannot 
reasonably dispute the existence here of several of the con­
ditions  that  this  Court  previously  regarded  as  crucial  to 
ﬁnding that the securities law impliedly precludes the appli­
cation of the antitrust laws. 
First, the activities in question here—the underwriters’ 
efforts jointly to promote and to sell newly issued securi­
ties—is central to the proper functioning of well-regulated 
capital markets.  The IPO process supports new ﬁrms that 
seek to raise capital; it helps to spread ownership of those 
ﬁrms  broadly  among  investors;  it  directs  capital  ﬂows  in 
ways that better correspond to the public’s demand for goods 
and  services.  Moreover,  ﬁnancial  experts,  including  the 
securities regulators, consider the general kind of joint un­
derwriting activity at issue in this case, including road shows 
and bookbuilding efforts essential to the successful market­
ing of an IPO.  See Memorandum Amicus Curiae of SEC in 
IPO  Antitrust,  Case  No.  01  CIV  2014  (WHP)  (SDNY), 
pp. 15, 39–40, App. D to Pet. for Cert. 124a, 138a, 155a–157a 
(hereinafter Brief for SEC).  Thus, the antitrust complaints 
before us concern practices that lie at the very heart of the 
securities marketing enterprise. 
Second, the law grants the SEC authority to supervise all 
of  the  activities  here  in  question.  Indeed,  the  SEC  pos­
sesses considerable power to forbid, permit, encourage, dis­
courage,  tolerate,  limit,  and  otherwise  regulate  virtually 
every aspect of the practices in which underwriters engage. 
See, e. g., 15 U. S. C. §§ 77b(a)(3), 77j, 77z–2 (granting SEC 
power to regulate the process of bookbuilding, solicitations

of “indications of interest,” and communications between un­
derwriting participants and their customers, including those 
that occur during road shows); § 78o(c)(2)(D) (granting SEC 
power to deﬁne and prevent through rules and regulations 
acts and practices that are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipu­
lative); § 78i(a)(6) (similar); § 78j(b) (similar).  Private indi­
viduals who suffer harm as a result of a violation of pertinent 
statutes  and  regulations  may  also  recover  damages.  See 
§§ 78bb, 78u–4, 77k. 
Third, the SEC has continuously exercised its legal author­
ity to regulate conduct of the general kind now at issue.  It 
has deﬁned in detail, for example, what underwriters may 
and may not do and say during their road shows.  Compare, 
e. g., Guidance Regarding Prohibited Conduct in Connection 
with IPO Allocations, 70 Fed. Reg. 19672 (2005), with Regu­
lation M, 17 CFR §§ 242.100–242.105 (2006).  It has brought 
actions against underwriters who have violated these SEC 
regulations.  See Brief for SEC 13–14, App. D to Pet. for 
Cert. 136a–138a.  And private litigants, too, have brought 
securities actions complaining of conduct virtually identical 
to the conduct at issue here; and they have obtained dam­
ages.  See, e. g., In re Initial Pub. Offering Securities Liti­
gation, 241 F. Supp. 2d 281 (SDNY 2003). 
The preceding considerations show that the ﬁrst condition 
(legal regulatory authority), the second condition (exercise 
of that authority), and the fourth condition (heartland securi­
ties activity) that were present in Gordon and NASD are 
satisﬁed in this case as well.  Unlike Silver, there is here no 
question of the existence of appropriate regulatory authority, 
nor is there doubt as to whether the regulators have exer­
cised that authority.  Rather, the question before us con­
cerns the third condition: Is there a conﬂict that rises to the 
level of incompatibility?  Is an antitrust suit such as this 
likely to prove practically incompatible with the SEC’s ad­
ministration of the Nation’s securities laws?

Opinion of the Court 
III 
A 
Given the SEC’s comprehensive authority to regulate IPO 
underwriting syndicates, its active and ongoing exercise of 
that authority, and the undisputed need for joint IPO under­
writer activity, we do not read the complaints as attacking 
the bare existence of IPO underwriting syndicates or any of 
the joint activity that the SEC considers a necessary compo­
nent of IPO-related syndicate activity.  See Brief for SEC 
15, 39–40, App. D to Pet. for Cert. 138a, 155a–157a.  See also 
IPO Antitrust, 287 F. Supp. 2d, at 507 (discussing the history 
of syndicate marketing of IPOs); App. 12 (complaint attacks 
underwriters “abus[e]” of “the preexisting practice of com­
bining  into  underwriting  syndicates”  (emphasis  added)); 
H. R. Rep. No. 1383, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 6–7 (1934); S. Rep. 
No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1934) (law must give to secu­
rities agencies freedom to regulate agreements among syndi­
cate members).  Nor do we understand the complaints as 
questioning underwriter agreements to ﬁx the levels of their 
commissions, whether or not the resulting price is “exces­
sive.”  See Gordon, 422 U. S., at 688–689 (securities law con­
ﬂicts with, and therefore precludes, antitrust attack on the 
ﬁxing of commissions where the SEC has not approved, but 
later might approve, the practice). 
We nonetheless can read the complaints as attacking the 
manner in which the underwriters jointly seek to collect “ex­
cessive” commissions.  The complaints attack underwriter 
efforts to collect commissions through certain practices (i. e., 
laddering,  tying,  collecting  excessive  commissions  in  the 
form of later sales of the issued shares), which according to 
respondents the SEC itself has already disapproved and, in 
all likelihood, will not approve in the foreseeable future.  In 
respect to this set of claims, they contend that there is no 
possible “conﬂict” since both securities law and antitrust law 
aim to prohibit the same undesirable activity.  Without a
