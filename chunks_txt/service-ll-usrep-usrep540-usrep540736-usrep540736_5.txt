748  POSTAL  SERVICE v. FLAMINGO INDUSTRIES (USA)  LTD.
Opinion of the Court
Commission, and in which it may seek profits to offset losses
in the postal business.  ยง 403(a).  The great majority of the
organization's  business, however, consists of postal services.
See Revenue, Pieces, and Weight by Classes of Mail and Spe-
cial  Services  for  Government  Fiscal  Year  2003,  available
at http://www.usps.com/financials/_pdf/GFY03.pdf  (as visited
Jan.  23,  2004,  and  available  in Clerk  of Court's  case  file).
Further, the  Postal  Service's  predecessor,  the  Post Office
Department, had nonpostal lines of business, such as money
orders  and  postal  savings  accounts.  Cullinan  84-85,  107.
As a Cabinet agency, the old Post Office Department was not
subject to the antitrust laws.  The new Postal Service's lines
of business beyond the scope of its mail monopoly and univer-
sal  service  obligation  do not  show it is  separate  from  the
Government under the antitrust laws.
The  Postal  Service,  in  both form  and  function,  is  not a
separate antitrust person from the United States.  It is part
of the  Government of the United  States and  so is not con-
trolled by the antitrust laws.  The judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed.
It is so ordered.
