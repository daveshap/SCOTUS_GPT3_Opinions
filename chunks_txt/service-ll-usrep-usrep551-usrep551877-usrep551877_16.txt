retailers worldwide has grown to nearly 30% of total retail

tail distribution including signiﬁcant increases in concentra­

Policy  Brief,  No.  3,  pp. 1,  2  (Spring  2007),  http://www.

25, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court’s case ﬁle) (noting 
that “[f]or many decades, the top ﬁve food retail ﬁrms in the 
U. S. controlled less than 20 percent of the market”; from 
1997 to 2000, “the top ﬁve ﬁrms increased their market share 
from 24 to 42 percent of all retail sales”; and “[b]y 2003, they 
controlled  over  half  of  all  grocery  sales”).  That  change, 
other things being equal, may enable (and motivate) more 
retailers, accounting for a greater percentage of total retail 
sales volume, to seek resale price maintenance, thereby mak­
ing it more difﬁcult for price-cutting competitors (perhaps 
internet retailers) to obtain market share. 
Nor has anyone argued that concentration among manufac­
turers that might use resale price maintenance has dimin­
ished signiﬁcantly.  And as far as I can tell, it has not.  Con­
sider household electrical appliances, which a study from the 
late 1950’s suggests constituted a signiﬁcant portion of those 
products subject to resale price maintenance at that time. 
See Hollander, United States of America, in Resale Price 
Maintenance 67, 80–81 (B. Yamey ed. 1966).  Although it is 
somewhat difﬁcult to compare census data from 2002 with 
that from several decades ago (because of changes in the 
classiﬁcation system), it is clear that at least some subsets of 
the household electrical appliance industry are more concen­
trated, in terms of manufacturer market power, now than 
they were then.  For instance, the top eight domestic manu­
facturers of household cooking appliances accounted for 68%

of the domestic market (measured by value of shipments) in 
1963 (the earliest date for which I was able to ﬁnd data), 
compared  with  77%  in  2002.  See  Dept.  of  Commerce, 
Bureau  of  Census,  1972  Census  of  Manufactures,  Special 
Report  Series,  Concentration  Ratios  in  Manufacturing, 
No. MC72(SR)–2, p. SR2–38 (1975) (hereinafter 1972 Cen­
sus); Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 2002 Economic 
Census, Concentration Ratios: 2002, No. EC02–31SR–1, p. 55 
(2006) (hereinafter 2002 Census).  The top eight domestic 
manufacturers of household laundry equipment accounted for 
95% of the domestic market in 1963 (90% in 1958), compared 
with 99% in 2002.  1972 Census, at SR2–38; 2002 Census, 
at 55.  And the top eight domestic manufacturers of house­
hold refrigerators and freezers accounted for 91% of the do­
mestic market in 1963, compared with 95% in 2002.  1972 
Census, at SR2–38; 2002 Census, at 55.  Increased concen­
tration among manufacturers increases the likelihood that 
producer-originated  resale  price  maintenance  will  prove 
more prevalent today than in years past, and more harmful. 
At the very least, the majority has not explained how these, 
or  other  changes  in  the  economy,  could  help  support  its 
position. 
In sum, there is no relevant change.  And without some 
such  change,  there  is  no  ground  for  abandoning  a  well­
established antitrust rule. 
B 
With the preceding discussion in mind, I would consult the 
list of factors that our case law indicates are relevant when 
we consider overruling an earlier case.  Justice Scalia, 
writing separately in another of our cases this Term, well 
summarizes that law.  See Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 
ante, at 500–503 (opinion concurring in part and concurring 
in judgment).  And every relevant factor he mentions ar­
gues against overruling Dr. Miles here. 
First,  the  Court  applies  stare  decisis  more  “rigidly”  in 
statutory than in constitutional cases.  See Glidden Co. v.

PSKS, INC. 
Breyer, J., dissenting 
Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 543 (1962); Illinois Brick Co., 431 
U. S., at 736.  This is a statutory case. 
Second, the Court does sometimes overrule cases that it 
decided wrongly only a reasonably short time ago.  As Jus­
tice Scalia put it, “[o]verruling a constitutional case de­
cided just a few years earlier is far from unprecedented.” 
Wisconsin Right to Life, ante, at 501 (emphasis added).  We 
here  overrule  one  statutory case,  Dr.  Miles,  decided  100 
years ago, and we overrule the cases that reafﬁrmed its per 
se rule in the intervening years.  See, e. g., Trenton Potter­
ies, 273 U. S., at 399–401; Bausch & Lomb, 321 U. S., at 721; 
United States  v.  Parke,  Davis & Co.,  362 U. S.  29, 45–47 
(1960);  Simpson  v.  Union  Oil  Co.  of  Cal.,  377  U. S.  13, 
16–17 (1964). 
Third, the fact that a decision creates an “unworkable” 
legal regime argues in favor of overruling.  See Payne v. 
Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827–828 (1991); Swift & Co.  v. Wick­
ham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965).  Implementation of the per 
se rule, even with the complications attendant the exception 
allowed for in United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300 
(1919), has proved practical over the course of the last cen­
tury, particularly when compared with the many complexi­
ties of litigating a case under the “rule of reason” regime. 
No one has shown how moving from the Dr. Miles regime 
to “rule of reason” analysis would make the legal regime 
governing minimum resale price maintenance more “admin­
istrable,” Wisconsin Right to Life, ante, at 501 (opinion of 
Scalia, J.), particularly since Colgate would remain good law 
with respect to unreasonable price maintenance. 
Fourth, the fact that a decision “unsettles” the law may 
argue in favor of overruling.  See Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 47; 
Wisconsin Right to Life, ante, at 502 (opinion of Scalia, J.). 
The per se rule is well-settled law, as the Court itself has 
previously recognized.  Sylvania, supra, at 51, n. 18.  It is 
the majority’s change here that will unsettle the law.
