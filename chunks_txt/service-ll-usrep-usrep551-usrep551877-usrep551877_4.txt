Opinion of the Court 
nesses involved have market power is a further, signiﬁcant 
consideration.  See, e. g., Copperweld Corp. v. Independence 
Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 768 (1984) (equating the rule of 
reason with “an inquiry into market power and market struc­
ture designed to assess [a restraint’s] actual effect”); see also 
Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., 547 U. S. 
28, 45–46 (2006).  In its design and function the rule distin­
guishes between restraints with anticompetitive effect that 
are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating com­
petition that are in the consumer’s best interest. 
The rule of reason does not govern all restraints.  Some 
types “are deemed unlawful per se.”  Khan, supra, at 10. 
The per se rule, treating categories of restraints as necessar­
ily illegal, eliminates the need to study the reasonableness 
of an individual restraint in light of the real market forces 
at work, Business Electronics Corp. v.  Sharp Electronics 
Corp.,  485 U. S. 717, 723 (1988); and, it must be acknowl­
edged, the per se rule can give clear guidance for certain 
conduct.  Restraints that are per se unlawful include hori­
zontal agreements among competitors to ﬁx prices, see Tex­
aco, supra, at 5, or to divide markets, see Palmer v. BRG of 
Ga., Inc., 498 U. S. 46, 49–50 (1990) (per curiam). 
Resort to per se rules is conﬁned to restraints, like those 
mentioned, “that would always or almost always tend to re­
strict  competition  and  decrease  output.”  Business  Elec­
tronics, supra, at 723 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
To justify a per se prohibition a restraint must have “mani­
festly anticompetitive” effects, GTE Sylvania, supra, at 50, 
and “ lack . . . any  redeeming virtue,” Northwest Wholesale 
Stationers, Inc. v.  Paciﬁc Stationery & Printing Co., 472 
U. S. 284, 289 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
As a consequence, the per se rule is appropriate only after 
courts have had considerable experience with the type of 
restraint at issue, see Broadcast Music, Inc. v.  Columbia 
Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 9 (1979), and only if 
courts can predict with conﬁdence that it would be invali­

Opinion of the Court 
dated in all or almost all instances under the rule of reason, 
see Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 
344 (1982).  It should come as no surprise, then, that “we 
have expressed reluctance to adopt per se rules with regard 
to restraints imposed in the context of business relationships 
where the economic impact of certain practices is not imme­
diately  obvious.”  Khan,  supra,  at  10  (internal  quotation 
marks omitted); see also White Motor Co. v. United States, 
372 U. S. 253, 263 (1963) (refusing to adopt a per se rule for 
a vertical nonprice restraint because of the uncertainty con­
cerning whether this type of restraint satisﬁed the demand­
ing standards necessary to apply a per se rule).  And, as we 
have stated, a “departure from the rule-of-reason standard 
must  be  based  upon  demonstrable  economic  effect  rather 
than . . . u  pon formalistic line drawing.”  GTE Sylvania, 
supra, at 58–59. 
III 
The Court has interpreted Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John 
D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373, as establishing a per se 
rule against a vertical agreement between a manufacturer 
and its distributor to set minimum resale prices.  See, e. g., 
Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 761 
(1984).  In Dr. Miles the plaintiff, a manufacturer of medi­
cines, sold its products only to distributors who agreed to 
resell them at set prices.  The Court found the manufactur­
er’s control of resale prices to be unlawful.  It relied on the 
common-law rule that “a general restraint upon alienation is 
ordinarily invalid.”  220 U. S., at 404–405.  The Court then 
explained that the agreements would advantage the distribu­
tors, not the manufacturer, and were analogous to a combina­
tion among competing distributors, which the law treated as 
void.  Id., at 407–408. 
The reasoning of the Court’s more recent jurisprudence 
has rejected the rationales on which Dr. Miles was based. 
By  relying on  the  common-law rule  against restraints  on 
alienation, id., at 404–405, the Court justiﬁed its decision

Opinion of the Court 
based on “formalistic” legal doctrine rather than “demon­
strable economic effect,” GTE Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 58–59. 
The Court in Dr. Miles relied on a treatise published in 1628, 
but failed to discuss in detail the business reasons that would 
motivate a manufacturer situated in 1911 to make use of ver­
tical price  restraints.  Yet the  Sherman Act’s use  of “re­
straint of trade” “invokes the common law itself, . . . not  
merely the static content that the common law had assigned 
to the term in 1890.”  Business Electronics, supra, at 732. 
The  general  restraint  on  alienation,  especially  in  the  age 
when then-Justice Hughes used the term, tended to evoke 
policy  concerns  extraneous  to  the  question  that  controls 
here.  Usually associated with land, not chattels, the rule 
arose  from  restrictions  removing  real  property  from  the 
stream of commerce for generations.  The Court should be 
cautious about putting dispositive weight on doctrines from 
antiquity  but  of  slight  relevance.  We  reafﬁrm  that  “the 
state of the common law 400 or even 100 years ago is irrele­
vant to the issue before us: the effect of the antitrust laws 
upon vertical distributional restraints in the American econ­
omy today.”  GTE Sylvania, supra, at 53, n. 21 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
Dr.  Miles,  furthermore,  treated  vertical  agreements  a 
manufacturer makes with its distributors as analogous to a 
horizontal combination among competing distributors.  See 
220 U. S., at 407–408.  In later cases, however, the Court 
rejected the approach of reliance on rules governing horizon­
tal restraints when deﬁning rules applicable to vertical ones. 
See, e. g., Business Electronics, supra, at 734 (disclaiming 
the “notion of equivalence between the scope of horizontal 
per se illegality and that of vertical per se illegality”); Mari­
copa County, supra, at 348, n. 18 (noting that “horizontal 
restraints  are  generally  less  defensible  than  vertical  re­
straints”).  Our recent cases formulate antitrust principles 
in accordance with the appreciated differences in economic 
effect between vertical and horizontal agreements, differ­
ences the Dr. Miles Court failed to consider.
