Opinion of the Court 
tinct brands at a single price.  As a single entity, a joint 
venture, like any other ﬁrm, must have the discretion to de­
termine the prices of the products that it sells, including the 
discretion to sell a product under two different brands at a 
single, uniﬁed price.  If Equilon’s price uniﬁcation policy is 
anticompetitive, then respondents should have challenged it 
pursuant to the rule of reason.2  But it would be inconsistent 
with this Court’s antitrust precedents to condemn the inter­
nal pricing decisions of a legitimate joint venture as per se 
unlawful.3 
The court below reached the opposite conclusion by invok­
ing the ancillary restraints doctrine.  369 F. 3d, at 1118– 
1124.  That  doctrine  governs  the  validity  of  restrictions 
imposed by a  legitimate business collaboration, such  as a 
business association or joint venture, on nonventure activi­
ties.  See, e. g., National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board 
of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 113–115 (1984); 
Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States, 394 U. S. 131, 135– 
136  (1969).  Under  the  doctrine,  courts  must  determine 
whether the nonventure restriction is a naked restraint on 
trade, and thus invalid, or one that is ancillary to the legiti­
mate and competitive purposes of the business association, 
and thus valid.  We agree with petitioners that the ancillary 
restraints doctrine has no application here, where the busi­
ness practice being challenged involves the core activity of 
the  joint  venture  itself—namely,  the  pricing  of  the  very 
2 Respondents have not put forth a rule of reason claim.  369 F. 3d, at 
1113.  Accordingly, we need not address petitioners’ alternative argument 
that § 1 of the Sherman Act is inapplicable to joint ventures. 
3 Respondents alternatively contend that petitioners should be held lia­
ble under the quick look doctrine.  To be sure, we have applied the quick 
look doctrine to business activities that are so plainly anticompetitive that 
courts need undertake only a cursory examination before imposing anti­
trust liability.  See California Dental Assn. v. FTC, 526 U. S. 756, 770 
(1999).  But for the same reasons that per se liability is unwarranted here, 
we conclude that petitioners cannot be held liable under the quick look 
doctrine.

8  TEXACO INC. v. DAGHER 
Opinion of the Court 
goods produced and sold by Equilon.  And even if we were 
to invoke the doctrine in these cases, Equilon’s pricing policy 
is clearly ancillary to the sale of its own products.  Judge 
Fernandez, dissenting from the ruling of the court below, put 
it well: 
“In this case, nothing more radical is afoot than the 
fact that an entity, which now owns all of the production, 
transportation, research, storage, sales and distribution 
facilities  for  engaging  in  the  gasoline  business,  also 
prices its own products.  It decided to price them the 
same, as any other entity could.  What could be more 
integral to the running of a business than setting a price 
for its goods and services?”  369 F. 3d, at 1127. 
See also Broadcast Music, supra, at 23 (“Joint ventures and 
other cooperative arrangements are . . . not usually unlawful, 
at least not as price-ﬁxing schemes, where the agreement on 
price is necessary to market the product at all”).

Because the pricing decisions of a legitimate joint venture 
do not fall within the narrow category of activity that is per 
se unlawful under § 1 of the Sherman Act, respondents’ anti­
trust claim cannot prevail.  Accordingly, the judgment of the 
Court of Appeals is reversed. 
It is so ordered. 
Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or deci­
sion of these cases.
