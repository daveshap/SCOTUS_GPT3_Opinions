Opinion of the Court 
in a majority of States for a large part of the past century 
up until 1975. 
It is also of note that during this time “when the legal 
environment in the [United States] was most favorable for 
[resale price maintenance], no more than a tiny fraction of 
manufacturers ever employed [resale price maintenance] con­
tracts.”  Overstreet 6; see also id., at 169 (noting that “no 
more than one percent of manufacturers, accounting for no 
more than ten percent of consumer goods purchases, ever 
employed [resale price maintenance] in any single year in 
the [United States]”); Scherer & Ross 549 (noting that “[t]he 
fraction of U. S. retail sales covered by [resale price mainte­
nance] in its heyday has been variously estimated at from 4 
to  10  percent”).  To  the  extent  consumers  demand  cheap 
goods, judging vertical price restraints under the rule of rea­
son  will  not  prevent  the  market  from  providing  them. 
Cf. Easterbrook 152–153 (noting that “S.S. Kresge (the old 
K-Mart) ﬂourished during the days of manufacturers’ great­
est freedom” because “discount stores offer a combination 
of price and service that many customers value” and that 
“[n]othing in restricted dealing threatens the ability of con­
sumers to ﬁnd low prices”); Scherer & Ross 557 (noting that 
“for the most part, the effects of the [Consumer Goods Pric­
ing Act] were imperceptible because the forces of competi­
tion had already repealed the [previous antitrust exemption] 
in their own quiet way”). 
For these reasons the Court’s decision in Dr. Miles Medi­
cal Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373 (1911), is 
now overruled.  Vertical price restraints are to be judged 
according to the rule of reason.

retailers.  Respondent did not make this allegation in the 
lower courts, and we do not consider it here. 
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and 
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this 
opinion. 
It is so ordered. 
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice 
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting. 
In Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 
U. S. 373, 394, 408–409 (1911), this Court held that an agree­
ment between a manufacturer of proprietary medicines and 
its dealers to ﬁx the minimum price at which its medicines 
could be sold was “invalid . . . under the [Sherman Act, 15 
U. S. C. § 1].”  This Court has consistently read Dr. Miles as 
establishing a bright-line rule that agreements ﬁxing mini­
mum  resale  prices  are  per  se  illegal.  See,  e. g.,  United 
States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U. S. 392, 399–401 (1927); 
NYNEX  Corp.  v.  Discon,  Inc.,  525  U. S.  128,  133  (1998). 
That per se rule is one upon which the legal profession, busi­
ness,  and  the  public  have  relied  for  close  to  a  century. 
Today the Court holds that courts must determine the law­
fulness of minimum resale price maintenance by applying, 
not a bright-line per se rule, but a circumstance-speciﬁc “rule 
of  reason.”  Ante,  at  907.  And  in  doing  so  it  overturns 
Dr. Miles. 
The Court justiﬁes its departure from ordinary considera­
tions of stare decisis by pointing to a set of arguments well 
known in the antitrust literature for close to half a century. 
See  ante,  at  889–892.  Congress  has  repeatedly  found  in 
these arguments insufﬁcient grounds for overturning the per 
se rule.  See, e. g., Hearings on H. R. 10527 et al. before the 
Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the House Com­
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 85th Cong., 2d 
Sess., 74–76, 89, 99, 101–102, 192–195, 261–262 (1958).  And,

in my view, they do not warrant the Court’s now overturning 
so well-established a legal precedent. 
I 
The Sherman Act seeks to maintain a marketplace free 
of anticompetitive practices, in particular those enforced by 
agreement among private ﬁrms.  The law assumes that such 
a marketplace, free of private restrictions, will tend to bring 
about the lower prices, better products, and more efﬁcient 
production  processes  that  consumers  typically  desire.  In 
determining  the  lawfulness  of  particular  practices,  courts 
often apply a “rule of reason.”  They examine both a prac­
tice’s likely anticompetitive effects and its beneﬁcial business 
justiﬁcations.  See, e. g., National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 109–110, 
and n. 39 (1984); National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. 
United States, 435 U. S. 679, 688–691 (1978); Board of Trade 
of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S. 231, 238 (1918). 
Nonetheless, sometimes the likely anticompetitive conse­
quences of a particular practice are so serious and the poten­
tial justiﬁcations so few (or, e. g., so difﬁcult to prove) that 
courts have departed from a pure “rule of reason” approach. 
And sometimes this Court has imposed a rule of per se un­
lawfulness—a rule that instructs courts to ﬁnd the practice 
unlawful all (or nearly  all) the time.  See, e. g., NYNEX, 
supra, at 133; Arizona v.  Maricopa County Medical Soc., 
457 U. S. 332, 343–344, and n. 16 (1982); Continental T. V., 
Inc. v.  GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 50, n. 16 (1977); 
United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 609– 
611  (1972);  United  States  v.  Socony-Vacuum  Oil  Co.,  310 
U. S. 150, 213–214 (1940) (citing and quoting Trenton Potter­
ies, supra, at 397–398). 
The case before us asks which kind of approach the courts 
should follow where minimum resale price maintenance is at 
issue.  Should they apply a per se rule (or a variation) that
