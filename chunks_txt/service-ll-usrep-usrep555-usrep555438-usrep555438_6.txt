explain or adequately and reasonably supervise.  The prob­
lem should be deemed irremedia[ble] by antitrust law when 
compulsory access requires the court to assume the day-to­
day controls characteristic of a regulatory agency.’ ”  Id., at 
415  (quoting  Areeda,  Essential  Facilities:  An  Epithet  in 
Need  of  Limiting  Principles,  58  Antitrust  L.  J.  841,  853 
(1989)); see also Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F. 2d 17, 
25 (CA1 1990) (Breyer, C. J.) (“[A]ntitrust courts normally 
avoid direct price administration, relying on rules and rem­
edies . . . that are easier to administer”). 
It is difﬁcult enough for courts to identify and remedy an 
alleged anticompetitive practice at one level, such as preda­
tory pricing in retail markets or a violation of the duty-to­
deal  doctrine  at  the  wholesale  level.  See  Brooke  Group, 
supra, at 225 (predation claims “requir[e] an understanding 
of the extent and duration of the alleged predation, the rel­
ative  ﬁnancial  strength  of  the  predator  and  its  intended 
victim, and their respective incentives and will”); Trinko, 
supra, at 408.  Recognizing price-squeeze claims would re­
quire courts simultaneously to police both the wholesale and 
retail  prices  to  ensure  that  rival  ﬁrms  are  not  being 
squeezed.  And courts would be aiming at a moving target, 
since it is the interaction between these two prices that may 
result in a squeeze. 
Perhaps most troubling, ﬁrms that seek to avoid price­
squeeze liability will have no safe harbor for their pricing 
practices.  See Concord, supra, at 22 (antitrust rules “must 
be clear enough for lawyers to explain them to clients”).  At 
least in the predatory pricing context, ﬁrms know they will 
not incur liability as long as their retail prices are above cost. 
Brooke Group, supra, at 223.  No such guidance is available 
for price-squeeze claims.  See, e. g., 3B P. Areeda & H. Ho­
venkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 767c, p. 138 (3d ed. 2008) (“[A]nti­
trust faces a severe problem not only in recognizing any § 2 
[price-squeeze]  offense,  but  also  in  formulating  a  suitable 
remedy”).

454  PACIFIC BELL TELEPHONE CO. v. LINKLINE 
COMMUNICATIONS, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
The most commonly articulated standard for price 
squeezes is that the defendant must leave its rivals a “fair” 
or “adequate” margin between the wholesale price and the 
retail price.  See Concord, supra, at 23–25; Alcoa, 148 F. 2d 
416, 437–438 (CA2 1945).  One of our colleagues has high­
lighted the ﬂaws of this test in Socratic fashion: 
“[H]ow is a judge or jury to determine a ‘fair price?’  Is 
it the price charged by other suppliers of the primary 
product?  None exist.  Is it the price that competition 
‘would have set’ were the primary level not monopo­
lized?  How can the court determine this price without 
examining  costs  and  demands,  indeed  without  acting 
like a rate-setting regulatory agency, the rate-setting 
proceedings of which often last for several years?  Fur­
ther, how is the court to decide the proper size of the 
price ‘gap?’  Must it be large enough for all independent 
competing ﬁrms to make a ‘living proﬁt,’ no matter how 
inefﬁcient they may be? . . . And how should the court 
respond when costs or demands change over time, as 
they inevitably will?”  Concord, supra, at 25. 
Some  amici  respond  to  these  concerns  by  proposing  a 
“transfer  price  test”  for  identifying  an  unlawful  price 
squeeze: A price squeeze should be presumed if the upstream 
monopolist could not have made a proﬁt by selling at its re­
tail rates if it purchased inputs at its own wholesale rates. 
Brief for American Antitrust Institute (AAI) 30; Brief for 
COMPTEL 16–19; see Ray v. Indiana & Mich. Elec. Co., 606 
F. Supp. 757, 776–777 (ND Ill. 1984).  Whether or not that 
test is administrable, it lacks any grounding in our antitrust 
jurisprudence.  An  upstream  monopolist  with  no  duty  to 
deal is free to charge whatever wholesale price it would like; 
antitrust law does not prohibit lawfully obtained monopolies 
from  charging  monopoly  prices.  Trinko,  supra,  at  407 
(“The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomi­
tant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it

Opinion of the Court 
is an important element of the free-market system”).  Simi­
larly, the Sherman Act does not forbid—indeed, it encour­
ages—aggressive price competition at the retail level, as long 
as  the  prices  being  charged  are  not  predatory.  Brooke 
Group, 509 U. S., at 223–224.  If both the wholesale price 
and the retail price are independently lawful, there is no 
basis for imposing antitrust liability simply because a verti­
cally integrated ﬁrm’s wholesale price happens to be greater 
than or equal to its retail price. 
2. Amici  assert  that  there  are  circumstances  in  which 
price squeezes may harm competition.  For example, they 
assert that price squeezes may raise entry barriers that for­
tify the upstream monopolist’s position; they also contend 
that price squeezes may impair nonprice competition and in­
novation in the downstream market by driving independent 
ﬁrms out of business.  See Brief for AAI 11–15; Concord, 
supra, at 23–24. 
The problem, however, is that amici have not identiﬁed 
any independent competitive harm caused by price squeezes 
above and beyond the harm that would result from a duty­
to-deal violation at the wholesale level or predatory pricing 
at the retail level.  See 3A P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, An­
titrust Law ¶ 767c, p. 126 (2d ed. 2002) (“[I]t is difﬁcult to 
see any competitive signiﬁcance [of a price squeeze] apart 
from the consequences of vertical integration itself”).  To 
the extent a monopolist violates one of these doctrines, the 
plaintiffs have a remedy under existing law.  We do not need 
to endorse a new theory of liability to prevent such harm. 
IV 
Lastly, as mentioned above, plaintiffs have asked us for 
leave to amend  their complaint to bring  a Brooke Group 
predatory pricing claim.  We need not decide whether leave 
to amend should be granted.  Our grant of certiorari was 
limited to the question whether price-squeeze claims are cog­
nizable in  the absence  of an  antitrust duty  to deal.  The
