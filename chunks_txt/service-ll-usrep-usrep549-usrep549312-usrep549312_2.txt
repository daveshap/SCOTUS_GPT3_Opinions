business by bidding up the price of sawlogs to a level that 
prevented Ross-Simmons from being proﬁtable.  A jury re­
turned a verdict in favor of Ross-Simmons on its monopo­
lization claim, and the Ninth Circuit afﬁrmed.  We granted 
certiorari to decide whether the test we applied to claims of 
predatory pricing in Brooke Group Ltd. v.  Brown & Wil­
liamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 209 (1993), also applies to 
claims of predatory bidding.  We hold that it does.  Accord­
ingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
I 
This antitrust case concerns the acquisition of red alder 
sawlogs by the mills that process those logs in the Paciﬁc 
Northwest.  These hardwood-lumber mills usually acquire 
logs in one of three ways.  Some logs are purchased on the 
open bidding market.  Some come to the mill through stand­
ing short- and long-term agreements with timberland own­
ers.  And others are harvested from timberland owned by 
the sawmills themselves.  The allegations relevant to our 
decision in this case relate to the bidding market. 
Ross-Simmons began operating a hardwood-lumber saw­
mill in Longview, Washington, in 1962.  Weyerhaeuser en­
tered the Northwestern hardwood-lumber market in 1980 by 
acquiring an existing lumber company.  Weyerhaeuser grad­
ually increased the scope of its hardwood-lumber operation, 
and it now owns six hardwood sawmills in the region.  By 
2001, Weyerhaeuser’s mills were acquiring approximately 65 
percent of the alder logs available for sale in the region. 
App. 754a, 341a. 
From 1990 to 2000, Weyerhaeuser made more than $75 
million in capital investments in its hardwood mills in the 
Paciﬁc Northwest.  Id., at 159a.  During this period, pro­
duction increased at every Northwestern hardwood mill that 
Weyerhaeuser owned.  Id., at 160a.  In addition to increas­
ing  production,  Weyerhaeuser  used  “state-of-the-art  tech­
nology,” id., at 500a, including sawing equipment, to increase 
the amount of lumber recovered from every log, id., at 500a,

316  WEYERHAEUSER CO. v. ROSS-SIMMONS HARDWOOD 
LUMBER CO. 
Opinion of the Court 
549a.  By contrast, Ross-Simmons appears to have engaged 
in little efﬁciency-enhancing investment.  See id., at 438a– 
441a. 
Logs represent up to 75 percent of a sawmill’s total costs. 
See id., at 169a.  And from 1998 to 2001, the price of alder 
sawlogs increased while prices for ﬁnished hardwood lumber 
fell.  These divergent trends in input and output prices cut 
into the mills’ proﬁt margins, and Ross-Simmons suffered 
heavy losses during this time.  See id., at 155a (showing a 
negative net income from 1998 to 2000).  Saddled with sev­
eral million dollars in debt, Ross-Simmons shut down its mill 
completely in May 2001.  Id., at 156a. 
Ross-Simmons blamed Weyerhaeuser for driving it out of 
business by bidding up input costs, and it ﬁled an antitrust 
suit against Weyerhaeuser for monopolization and attempted 
monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act.  See 26 Stat. 
209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 2 (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  Ross-
Simmons  alleged  that,  among  other  anticompetitive  acts, 
Weyerhaeuser had used “its dominant position in the alder 
sawlog market to drive up the prices for alder sawlogs to 
levels that severely reduced or eliminated the proﬁt margins 
of Weyerhaeuser’s alder sawmill competition.”  App. 135a. 
Proceeding  in  part  on  this  “predatory-bidding”  theory, 
Ross-Simmons argued that Weyerhaeuser had overpaid for 
alder sawlogs to cause sawlog prices to rise to artiﬁcially 
high levels as part of a plan to drive Ross-Simmons out of 
business.  As proof that this practice had occurred, Ross-
Simmons pointed to Weyerhaeuser’s large share of the alder 
purchasing market, rising alder sawlog prices during the al­
leged predation period, and Weyerhaeuser’s declining proﬁts 
during that same period. 
Prior to  trial, Weyerhaeuser  moved for summary  judg­
ment on Ross-Simmons’ predatory-bidding theory.  Id., at 
6a–24a.  The District Court denied the motion.  Id., at 58a– 
69a.  At the close of the 9-day trial, Weyerhaeuser moved 
for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a new

Opinion of the Court 
trial.  The motions were based in part on Weyerhaeuser’s 
argument that Ross-Simmons had not satisﬁed the standard 
this Court set forth in Brooke Group, supra.  App. 940a– 
942a.  The  District  Court  denied  Weyerhaeuser’s  motion. 
Id., at 720a, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.  The District Court 
also rejected proposed predatory-bidding jury instructions 
that incorporated elements of the Brooke Group test.  App. 
725a–730a, 978a.  Ultimately, the District Court instructed 
the jury that Ross-Simmons could prove that Weyerhaeus­
er’s bidding practices were anticompetitive acts if the jury 
concluded that Weyerhaeuser “purchased more logs than it 
needed, or paid a higher price for logs than necessary, in 
order  to  prevent  [Ross-Simmons]  from  obtaining  the  logs 
they needed  at a  fair price.”  Id., at  978a.  Finding that 
Ross-Simmons had proved its claim for monopolization, the 
jury returned a $26 million verdict against Weyerhaeuser. 
Id., at 967a.  The verdict was trebled to approximately $79 
million. 
Weyerhaeuser appealed to the Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth  Circuit.  There,  Weyerhaeuser  argued  that  Brooke 
Group’s standard for claims of predatory pricing should also 
apply  to  claims  of  predatory  bidding.  The  Ninth  Circuit 
disagreed and afﬁrmed the verdict against Weyerhaeuser. 
Confederated  Tribes  of  Siletz  Indians  of  Ore.  v.  Weyer­
haeuser Co., 411 F. 3d 1030, 1035–1036 (2005). 
The Court of Appeals reasoned that “buy-side predatory 
bidding” and “sell-side predatory pricing,” though similar, 
are materially different in that predatory bidding does not 
necessarily beneﬁt consumers or stimulate competition in the 
way that predatory pricing does.  Id., at 1037.  Concluding 
that “the concerns that led the Brooke Group Court to estab­
lish a high standard of liability in the predatory pricing con­
text do not carry over to this predatory bidding context with 
the  same  force,”  the  Court  of  Appeals  declined  to  apply 
Brooke Group to Ross-Simmons’ claims of predatory bidding.
