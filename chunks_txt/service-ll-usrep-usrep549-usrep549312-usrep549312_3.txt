318  WEYERHAEUSER CO. v. ROSS-SIMMONS HARDWOOD 
LUMBER CO. 
Opinion of the Court 
clude that substantial evidence supported a ﬁnding of lia­
bility on the predatory-bidding theory.  Id., at 1045.  We 
granted certiorari to decide whether Brooke Group applies 
to claims of predatory bidding.  548 U. S. 903 (2006).  We 
hold  that  it  does,  and  we  vacate  the  Court  of  Appeals’ 
judgment. 
II 
In  Brooke  Group,  we  considered  what  a  plaintiff  must 
show in order to succeed on a claim of predatory pricing 
under  § 2  of  the  Sherman  Act.1  In  a  typical  predatory­
pricing scheme, the predator reduces the sale price of its 
product (its output) to below cost, hoping to drive competi­
tors out of business.  Then, with competition vanquished, 
the predator raises output prices to a supracompetitive level. 
See Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 
475 U. S. 574, 584–585, n. 8 (1986) (describing predatory pric­
ing).  For the scheme to make economic sense, the losses 
suffered from pricing goods below cost must be recouped 
(with interest) during the supracompetitive-pricing stage of 
the  scheme.  Id.,  at  588–589;  Cargill,  Inc.  v.  Monfort  of 
Colo., Inc., 479 U. S. 104, 121–122, n. 17 (1986); see also R. 
Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 145 (1978).  Recognizing this 
economic reality, we established two prerequisites to recov­
ery on claims of predatory pricing.  “First, a plaintiff seek­
ing to establish competitive injury resulting from a rival’s 
low  prices  must  prove  that  the  prices  complained  of  are 
below an appropriate measure of its rival’s costs.”  Brooke 
Group, 509 U. S., at 222.  Second, a plaintiff must demon­
strate that “the competitor had . . . a   dangerous probabilit[y] 
1 Brooke Group dealt with a claim under the Robinson-Patman Act, but 
as we observed, “primary-line competitive injury under the Robinson-
Patman Act is of the same general character as the injury inﬂicted by 
predatory pricing schemes actionable under § 2 of the Sherman Act.”  509 
U. S., at 221.  Because of this similarity, the standard adopted in Brooke 
Group applies to predatory-pricing claims under § 2 of the Sherman Act. 
Id., at 222.

Opinion of the Court 
of  recouping  its  investment  in  below-cost  prices.”  Id., 
at 224. 
The ﬁrst prong of the test—requiring that prices be below 
cost—is necessary because “[a]s a general rule, the exclusion­
ary effect of prices above a relevant measure of cost either 
reﬂects the lower cost structure of the alleged predator, and 
so represents competition on the merits, or is beyond the 
practical ability of a judicial tribunal to control.”  Id., at 223. 
We were particularly wary of allowing recovery for above­
cost price cutting because allowing such claims could, per­
versely, “chil[l] legitimate price cutting,” which directly ben­
eﬁts consumers.  See id., at 223–224; Atlantic Richﬁeld Co. 
v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328, 340 (1990) (“Low prices 
beneﬁt consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and 
so  long  as  they  are  above  predatory  levels,  they  do  not 
threaten  competition”).  Thus,  we  speciﬁcally  declined  to 
allow plaintiffs to recover for above-cost price cutting, con­
cluding that “discouraging a price cut and . . . depriving con­
sumers of the beneﬁts of lower prices . . .  does not constitute 
sound antitrust policy.”  Brooke Group, supra, at 224. 
The second prong of the Brooke Group test—requiring 
that  there  be  a  dangerous  probability  of  recoupment  of 
losses—is necessary because, without a dangerous probabil­
ity of recoupment, it is highly unlikely that a ﬁrm would 
engage  in  predatory  pricing.  As  the  Court  explained  in 
Matsushita, a ﬁrm engaged in a predatory-pricing scheme 
makes an investment—the losses suffered plus the proﬁts 
that would have been realized absent the scheme—at the 
initial, below-cost-selling phase.  475 U. S., at 588–589.  For 
that investment to be rational, a ﬁrm must reasonably expect 
to recoup in the long run at least its original investment with 
supracompetitive proﬁts.  Ibid.; Brooke Group, 509 U. S., at 
224.  Without such a reasonable expectation, a rational ﬁrm 
would not willingly suffer deﬁnite, short-run losses.  Recog­
nizing the centrality of recoupment to a predatory-pricing 
scheme, we required predatory-pricing plaintiffs to “demon­

Opinion of the Court 
strate that there is a likelihood that the predatory scheme 
alleged would cause a rise in prices above a competitive level 
that would be sufﬁcient to compensate for the amounts ex­
pended  on  the  predation,  including the  time  value  of  the 
money invested in it.”  Id., at 225. 
We described the two parts of the Brooke Group test as 
“essential components of real market injury” that were “not 
easy to establish.”  Id., at 226.  We also reiterated that the 
costs of erroneous ﬁndings of predatory-pricing liability were 
quite high because “ ‘[t]he mechanism by which a ﬁrm en­
gages  in  predatory  pricing—lowering  prices—is  the  same 
mechanism by which a ﬁrm stimulates competition,’ ” and, 
therefore, mistaken ﬁndings of liability would “ ‘ “chill the 
very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.” ’ ”

Predatory  bidding,  which  Ross-Simmons  alleges  in  this 
case, involves the exercise of market power on the buy side 
or input side of a market.  In a predatory-bidding scheme, a 
purchaser of inputs “bids up the market price of a critical 
input to such high levels that rival buyers cannot survive (or 
compete as vigorously) and, as a result, the predating buyer 
acquires (or maintains or increases its) monopsony power.” 
Kirkwood, Buyer Power and Exclusionary Conduct, 72 Anti­
trust L. J. 625, 652 (2005) (hereinafter Kirkwood).  Monop­
sony power is market power on the buy side of the market. 
Blair & Harrison, Antitrust Policy and Monopsony, 76 Cor­
nell L. Rev. 297 (1991).  As such, a monopsony is to the buy 
side of the market what a monopoly is to the sell side and is 
sometimes colloquially called a “buyer’s monopoly.”  See id., 
at 301, 320; Piraino, A Proposed Antitrust Approach to Buy­
ers’ Competitive Conduct, 56 Hastings L. J. 1121, 1125 (2005). 
A predatory bidder ultimately aims to exercise the monop­
sony power gained from bidding up input prices.  To that 
end, once the predatory bidder has caused competing buyers
