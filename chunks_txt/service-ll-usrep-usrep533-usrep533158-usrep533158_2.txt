Opinion of the Court
cate  crimes.  The  District Court,  citing Court  of Appeals
precedent, dismissed the complaint.  Civ. No. 98-6859, 1999
WL 771366, *3-4 (SDNY, Sept. 28, 1999).  And the Court of
Appeals  affirmed that dismissal.  219 F. 3d  115 (CA2 2000)
(per curiam).  In the appellate court's view, § 1962(c) applies
only  where a plaintiff shows the existence  of two separate
entities, a "person" and a distinct "enterprise," the affairs of
which  that "person" improperly conducts.  Id.,  at 116.  In
this instance, "it is undisputed that King was  an employee"
of the corporation  Don  King Productions  and  also "acting
within the scope of his authority."  Id., at 117.  Under the
Court of Appeals'  analysis, King, in a legal sense, was part
of, not separate from, the corporation.  There was no "per-
son,"  distinct from  the "enterprise,"  who  improperly  con-
ducted the "enterprise's affairs."  And thus § 1962(c)  did not
apply.  Ibid.
Other  Circuits, applying  § 1962(c)  in roughly  similar cir-
cumstances,  have reached  a contrary conclusion.  See, e. g.,
Brannon v. Boatmen's First Nat. Bank of Okla., 153 F. 3d
1144,1148, n. 4 (CA10 1998); Richmond v. Nationwide Cassel
L. P., 52 F. 3d 640, 647 (CA7 1995); JaguarC  ars, Inc. v. Royal
Oaks Motor Car Co., 46 F. 3d 258, 265, 269 (CA3 1995); Sever
v. Alaska Pulp Corp., 978 F. 2d 1529, 1534 (CA9 1992).  We
granted  certiorari  to  resolve  the conflict.  We  now  agree
with these Circuits and hold that the Second Circuit's inter-
pretation of § 1962(c) is erroneous.
We do not quarrel with the basic principle that to establish
liability under § 1962(c) one must allege and prove the exist-
ence of two distinct entities: (1) a "person"; and (2) an "enter-
prise" that is not simply the same "person" referred  to by
a different name.  The statute's language, read as ordinary
English,  suggests  that  principle.  The  Act  says  that  it
applies to  "person[s]"  who are  "employed  by  or associated
with" the "enterprise."  § 1962(c).  In ordinary English one
speaks of employing, being employed by, or associating with
others, not oneself.  See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 132 (1993) (defining "associate"); id., at 743 (defin-

ing "employ").  In addition, the Act's purposes are consist-
ent with that principle.  Whether the Act seeks to prevent
a  person  from  victimizing, say, a  small  business,  S.  Rep.
No. 91-617, p. 77 (1969),  or to prevent a person from using a
corporation  for  criminal  purposes,  National Organization
for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 259 (1994),  the
person and the victim, or the person and the tool, are differ-
ent entities, not the same.
The Government reads § 1962(c) "to require some distinct-
ness  between  the  RICO  defendant  and  the  RICO  enter-
prise."  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11.  And
it says  that  this  requirement  is  "legally  sound  and  work-
able."  Ibid.  We  agree  with  its  assessment,  particularly
in light of the  fact that  12  Courts of Appeals have  inter-
preted the statute as embodying some such distinctness re-
quirement without  creating  discernible  mischief in the  ad-
ministration  of RICO.  See  St.  Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v.
Williamson, 224 F. 3d 425, 445 (CA5 2000);  United States v.

Opinion of the Court
denied, 531 U. S. 1050 (2001).  Indeed, this Court previously
has said that liability "depends on showing that the defend-
ants conducted or participated in the conduct of the 'enter-
prise's affairs,' not just their own affairs."  Reves v. Ernst &
Young, 507 U. S. 170, 185 (1993).
While accepting  the "distinctness" principle, we nonethe-
less disagree  with  the  appellate  court's  application  of that
principle  to  the  present  circumstances-circumstances  in
which  a  corporate  employee,  "acting  within  the  scope  of
his authority," 219 F. 3d, at 117, allegedly conducts  the cor-
poration's affairs  in a RICO-forbidden  way.  The corporate
owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corpo-
ration itself, a legally different entity with different  rights
and  responsibilities  due  to  its different  legal  status.  And
we can find nothing in the statute that requires more "sepa-
rateness" than that.  Cf. McCullough v. Suter, 757 F. 2d 142,
144 (CA7 1985) (finding either formal or practical  separate-
ness sufficient to be distinct under § 1962(c)).
Linguistically speaking, an employee who conducts the af-
fairs of a corporation  through illegal acts comes within the
terms  of a statute that forbids  any  "person" unlawfully  to
conduct  an "enterprise,"  particularly when the  statute  ex-
plicitly defines "person" to include "any individual...  capa-
ble of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property," and
defines "enterprise" to include a "corporation."  18 U. S. C.
§§ 1961(3),  (4).  And, linguistically  speaking, the employee
and the corporation are different "persons," even where the
employee is the corporation's sole owner.  After all, incorpo-
ration's basic purpose is to create a distinct legal entity, with
legal  rights,  obligations,  powers,  and  privileges  different
from those of the natural individuals who created it, who own
it, or whom it employs.  See United States v. Bestfoods, 524
U. S.  51,  61-62  (1998);  Burnet v.  Clark, 287  U. S.  410, 415
(1932);  1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Cor-
porations  §§ 7, 14 (rev. ed. 1999).
