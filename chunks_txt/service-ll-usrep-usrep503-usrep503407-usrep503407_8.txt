428  NATIONAL RAILROAD  PASSENGER CORPORATION v.
BOSTON & MAINE  CORP.
WHITE, J., dissenting
a Government  lawyer is another matter entirely.  "For the
courts to substitute their or counsel's discretion  for that of
the Commission is incompatible  with the orderly functioning
of the process of judicial review."  Id., at 169.  Because the
ICC has failed to provide a clear, authoritative  construction
of "required for intercity rail passenger service," we should
return this  case to the Commission so that the agency  can
do its job properly.  But we should not strain the Chevron
principle by deferring to what we imagine an agency had in
mind  when it  applied a  statute.  Therefore,  I  respectfully
dissent.
