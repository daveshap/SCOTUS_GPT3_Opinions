Opinion of the Court
III
Both petitioners and their supporters advance several sug-
gestions for drawing the exemption boundary  line short of
this case.  We shall explain why we find them unsatisfactory.
A
Petitioners claim that the implicit exemption applies  only
to labor-management agreements-a limitation that they de-
duce from case law language, see, e. g., Connell, 421 U. S., at
622 (exemption for "some union-employer agreements") (em-
phasis added),  and from a proposed principle-that the ex-
emption  must  rest upon  labor-management  consent.  The
language,  however,  reflects  only  the  fact  that  the  cases
previously before  the Court involved  collective-bargaining
agreements,  see  id., at 619-620;  Pennington, 381  U. S., at
660;  Jewel Tea, supra, at 679-680;  the language  does  not
reflect the exemption's rationale, see 50 F. 3d, at 1050.
Nor do we see how an exemption limited by petitioners'
principle  of  labor-management  consent  could  work.  One
cannot  mean  the  principle  literally-that  the  exemption
applies  only  to  understandings  embodied  in  a  collective-
bargaining agreement-for the collective-bargaining process
may take place before the making of any agreement or after
an agreement has expired.  Yet a multiemployer bargaining
process itself necessarily involves many procedural and sub-
stantive understandings  among participating employers  as
well as with the union.  Petitioners cannot rescue their prin-
ciple by claiming that the exemption applies only insofar as
both labor and management consent to'those understandings.
Often labor will not (and should not) consent to certain com-
mon bargaining positions that employers intend to maintain.
Cf. Areeda  & Hovenkamp,  Antitrust  Law  229'd,  at 277
("[J]oint employer preparation and bargaining in the context
of a  formal  multi-employer  bargaining  unit  is  clearly  ex-
empt").  Similarly, labor need not consent to certain tactics
that this Court has approved  as part of the multiemployer

bargaining process, such as unit-wide lockouts and the use of
temporary  replacements.  See  NLRB  v.  Brown, 380  U. S.
278, 284 (1965); Buffalo Linen, 353 U. S., at 97.
Petitioners  cannot save their consent  principle by weak-
ening it, as by requiring union consent  only to the multi-
employer bargaining process itself.  This general consent is
automatically  present  whenever  multiemployer  bargaining
takes place.  See Hi-Way Billboards, Inc., 206  N. L. R. B.
22 (1973) (multiemployer unit "based on consent" and "estab-
lished by an unequivocal agreement by the parties"), enf. de-
nied on  other grounds,  500  F. 2d  181  (CA5  1974);  Weyer-
haeuser Co.,  166  N. L.  R. B.  299,  299-300  (1967).  As  so
weakened,  the principle  cannot  help  decide  which related
practices are, or are not, subject to antitrust immunity.
B
The Government argues that the exemption should termi-
nate at the point of impasse.  After impasse, it says, "em-
ployers no longer have a duty under the labor laws to main-
tain the status quo,"  and "are free as a matter of labor law
to negotiate  individual  arrangements  on  an  interim  basis
with the union."  Brief for  United  States  et al. as Amici
Curiae 17.
Employers, however, are not completely free at impasse. to
act independently.  The multiemployer bargaining unit ordi-
narily remains intact; individual employers cannot withdraw.
Bonanno Linen, 454 U. S., at 410-413.  The duty to bargain
survives;  employers must stand ready to resume  collective
bargaining.  See,  e. g.,  Worldwide  Detective  Bureau, 296
N. L. R. B. 148,  155 (1989);  Hi-Way Billboards, Inc., supra,
at 23.  And individual employers can negotiate individual in-
terim agreements with the union only insofar as those agree-
ments are consistent with "the duty to abide by the results
of group bargaining."  Bonanno Linen, supra, at 416.  Re-
gardless, the absence  of a legal "duty"  to act jointly is not
determinative.  This Court has implied antitrust immunities

that extend beyond statutorily required joint action to joint
action  that a  statute "expressly  or impliedly allows  or  as-
sumes  must  also be immune."  1 P. Areeda  & D. Turner,
Antitrust Law  224, p. 145 (1978); see, e. g., Gordon v. New
York Stock Exchange, Inc., 422 U. S. 659, 682-691 (1975) (im-
munizing application of joint rule that securities law permit-
ted, but did not require);  United States v. National Assn. of
Securities Dealers,I nc., 422 U. S. 694, 720-730 (1975) (same).
More  importantly, the  simple  "impasse"  line  would  not
solve  the basic problem  we have  described above.  Supra,
at 241-242.  Labor law permits employers, after impasse, to
engage in considerable joint behavior,  including joint lock-
outs  and  replacement  hiring.  See, e. g.,  Brown, supra, at
289 (hiring of temporary replacement workers after lockout
was "reasonably adapted to the achievement of a legitimate
end-preserving the integrity of the multiemployer bargain-
ing unit").  Indeed, as a general matter, labor law often lim-
its employers  to four  options  at impasse:  (1) maintain the
status quo, (2) implement their last offer, (3) lock out their
workers  (and either shut down  or hire temporary  replace-
ments),  or (4) negotiate  separate  interim  agreements with
the union.  See generally 1 Hardin, The Developing Labor
Law, at 516-520, 696-699.  'What  is to happen if the parties
cannot reach an interim agreement?  The other alternatives
are limited.  Uniform employer conduct is likely.  Uniform-
ity-at least when accompanied by discussion of the matter-
invites antitrust  attack.  And  such attack  would  ask anti-
trust courts to decide the lawfulness of activities intimately
related to the bargaining process.
The problem is aggravated by the fact that "impasse" is
often temporary, see Bonanno Linen, supra, at 412 (approv-
ing Board's view of impasse as "a recurring feature in the
bargaining process,  . . .'a temporary  deadlock or hiatus in
negotiations which in almost all cases  is eventually broken,
through either a change  of mind  or the application  of eco-
nomic force")  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted); W. Sim-
