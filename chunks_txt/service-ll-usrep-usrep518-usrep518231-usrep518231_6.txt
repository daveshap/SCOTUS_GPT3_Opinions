Opinion of the Court
kin & N. Fidandis, Mediation and the Dynamics of Collective
Bargaining 139-140 (2d ed. 1986); it may differ from bargain-
ing  only in degree,  see  1 Hardin,  supra, at 691-696;  Taft
Broadcasting Co., 163 N. L. R. B., at 478; it may be manipu-
lated by the parties for bargaining purposes, see Bonanno
Linen, supra, at 413, n. 8  (parties might, for strategic pur-
poses,  "precipitate  an  impasse");  and  it may  occur  several
times during the course of a single labor dispute, since the
bargaining  process  is  not  over  when  the  first  impasse  is
reached,  cf. J. Bartlett, Familiar Quotations  754:8 (16th  ed.
1992).  How  are  employers  to  discuss  future  bargaining
positions  during a temporary impasse?  Consider, too, the
adverse consequences that flow from failing to guess how an
antitrustc ourt would later draw the impasse line.  Employ-
ers who  erroneously  concluded  that impasse had not been
reached would risk antitrust liability were they collectively
to maintain the status quo, while employers who erroneously
concluded that impasse had occurred would risk unfair labor
practice charges for prematurely suspending multiemployer
negotiations.
The United States  responds with suggestions for soften-
ing an "impasse" rule by extending the exemption after im-
passe "for such time as would be reasonable  in the circum-
stances" for employers to consult with counsel, confirm that
impasse has occurred, and adjust their business operations,
Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae2 4; by reestab-
lishing the exemption  once there is a "resumption of good-
faith bargaining," id., at 18, n. 5; and by looking to antitrust
law's "rule of reason" to shield-"in some circumstances"--
such joint actions  as the unit-wide lockout or the concerted
maintenance of previously established joint benefit or retire-
ment  plans,  ibid.  But  even  as  so  modified,  the  impasse-
related rule creates an exemption that can evaporate in the
middle  of the  bargaining  process,  leaving  later  antitrust
courts free to second-guess the parties' bargaining decisions

and  consequently  forcing  them to  choose  their  collective-
bargaining responses  in light of what they predict or fear
that antitrust courts, not labor law administrators, will even-
tually decide.  Cf. Dallas General Drivers, Warehousemen
and Helpers, Local Union No. 745 v. NLRB, 355 F. 2d 842,
844-845 (CADC 1966) ("The problem of deciding when fur-
ther bargaining...  is futile is often difficult for the bargain-
ers and is necessarily so for the Board.  But in the whole
complex of industrial relations few issues are less suited to
appellate judicial appraisal..,  or better suited to the expert
experience  of  a  board  which  deals  constantly  with  such
problems").

Petitioners  and their supporters argue in the alternative
for a rule that would exempt postimpasse agreement about
bargaining  "tactics,"  but not postimpasse  agreement about
substantive "terms," from the reach of antitrust.  See 50 F.
3d,  at  1066-1069  (Wald,  J.,  dissenting).  They  recognize,
however, that both the Board and the courts have said that
employers  can,  and  often  do,  employ  the  imposition  of
"terms" as a bargaining "tactic."  See, e. g., American Ship
Building Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300, 316 (1965);  Colorado-
Ute Elec. Assn., Inc. v. NLRB, 939 F. 2d 1392, 1404 (CA10
1991),  cert. denied, 504 U. S. 955 (1992);  Circuit-Wise, Inc.,
309  N. L.  R. B.  905,  921  (1992);  Hi-Way Billboards, 206
N. L. R. B., at 23; Bonanno Linen, 243 N. L. R. B., at 1094.
This concession as to joint "tactical" implementation would
turn the presence of an antitrust exemption upon a determi-
nation of the employers'  primary purpose  or motive.  See,
e. g., 50 F. 3d, at 1069 (Wald, J., dissenting).  But to ask anti-
trust  courts, insulated  from the bargaining process,  to in-
vestigate  an  employer  group's subjective  motive  is to  ask
them to conduct an inquiry often more amorphous than those
we have  previously  discussed.  And, in our view, a  labor/
antitrust line  drawn  on such a basis would  too often raise

the  same  related  (previously  discussed)  problems.  See
supra, at 237, 241-242; Jewel Tea, 381 U. S., at 716 (opinion

Petitioners  make several  other arguments.  They point,
for  example,  to  cases  holding  applicable,  in  collective-
bargaining  contexts,  general  "backdrop"  statutes,  such  as
a state statute requiring a plant-closing employer to make
employee  severance  payments,  Fort Halifax Packing Co.
v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1 (1987),  and  a state statute mandating
certain  minimum  health  benefits,  Metropolitan Life  Ins.
Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985).  Those statutes,
however,  "'neither  encourage[d]  nor  discourage[d]  the
collective-bargaining  processes  that are  the subject  of the
[federal  labor laws]."'  Fort Halifax, supra, at 21  (quoting
Metropolitan Life, supra, at 755).  Neither  did those stat-
utes come accompanied with antitrust's labor-related history.
Cf. Oliver, 358 U. S., at 295-297 (state antitrust law inter-
feres  with  collective  bargaining  and  is  not  applicable  to
labor-management agreement).
Petitioners also say that irrespective of how the labor ex-
emption  applies  elsewhere to multiemployer  collective  bar-
gaining, professional sports is "special."  We can understand
how professional sports may be special in terms of, say, in-
terest, excitement, or concern.  But we do not understand
how  they  are  special  in  respect  to  labor  law's  antitrust
exemption.  We concede that the clubs that make up a pro-
fessional sports league are not completely independent eco-
nomic competitors, as they depend upon a degree of coopera-
tion  for  economic  survival.  National Collegiate Athletic

sioner).  In the present context, however, that circumstance
