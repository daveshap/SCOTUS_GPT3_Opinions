Opinion of the Court 
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court. 
In Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U. S. 
2 (1984), we repeated the well-settled proposition that “if 
the Government has granted the seller a patent or similar 
monopoly over a product, it is fair to presume that the inabil­
ity to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market 
power.”  Id., at 16.  This presumption of market power, ap­
plicable in the antitrust context when a seller conditions its 
sale of a patented product (the “tying” product) on the pur­
chase of a second product (the “tied” product), has its founda­
tion in the judicially created patent misuse doctrine.  See 
United States v. Loew’s Inc., 371 U. S. 38, 46 (1962).  In 1988, 
Congress substantially undermined that foundation, amend­
ing the Patent Act to eliminate the market power presump­
tion in patent misuse cases.  See 102 Stat. 4676, codiﬁed at 
35 U. S. C. § 271(d).  The question presented to us today is 
whether  the  presumption  of  market  power  in  a  patented 
product should survive as a matter of antitrust law despite 
its demise in patent law.  We conclude that the mere fact 
that a tying product is patented does not support such a 
presumption.

Petitioners,  Trident,  Inc.,  and  its  parent,  Illinois  Tool 
Works Inc., manufacture and market printing systems that 
include three relevant components: (1) a patented piezoelec­
tric impulse ink jet printhead; (2) a patented ink container, 
consisting of a bottle and valved cap, which attaches to the 
printhead; and (3) specially designed, but unpatented, ink.

32  ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. v. INDEPENDENT INK, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
Petitioners sell their systems to original equipment manufac­
turers (OEMs) who are licensed to incorporate the print­
heads and containers into printers that are in turn sold to 
companies for use in printing barcodes on cartons and pack­
aging materials.  The OEMs agree that they will purchase 
their ink exclusively from petitioners, and that neither they 
nor their customers will reﬁll the patented containers with 
ink of any kind. 
Respondent, Independent Ink, Inc., has developed an ink 
with the same chemical composition as the ink sold by peti­
tioners.  After an infringement action brought by Trident 
against Independent was dismissed for lack of personal juris­
diction,  Independent  ﬁled  suit  against  Trident  seeking  a 
judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of Trident’s pat­
ents.1  In an amended complaint, it alleged that petitioners 
are engaged in illegal tying and monopolization in violation 
of §§1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  15 U. S. C. §§1, 2. 
After  discovery,  the  District  Court  granted  petitioners’ 
motion for summary judgment on the Sherman Act claims. 
Independent Ink, Inc. v. Trident, Inc., 210 F. Supp. 2d 1155, 
1177 (CD Cal. 2002).  It rejected respondent’s submission 
that petitioners “necessarily have market power in the mar­
ket for the tying product as a matter of law solely by virtue 
of the patent on their printhead system, thereby rendering 
[the] tying arrangements per se violations of the antitrust 
laws.”  Id., at 1159.  Finding that respondent had submit­
ted no afﬁrmative evidence deﬁning the relevant market or 
establishing petitioners’ power within it, the court concluded 
that respondent could not prevail on either antitrust claim. 
Id.,  at  1167,  1173,  1177.  The  parties  settled  their  other 
claims, and respondent appealed. 
After a careful review of the “long history of Supreme 
Court consideration of the legality of tying arrangements,” 
396 F. 3d 1342, 1346 (2005), the Court of Appeals for the 
1 Illinois Tool did not acquire Trident until February 19, 1999, approxi­
mately six months after this action commenced.

Opinion of the Court 
Federal Circuit reversed the District Court’s decision as to 
respondent’s § 1 claim, id., at 1354.  Placing special reliance 
on our decisions in International Salt Co. v. United States, 
332 U. S. 392 (1947), and Loew’s, 371 U. S. 38, as well as our 
Jefferson Parish dictum, and after taking note of the aca­
demic criticism of those cases, it concluded that the “funda­
mental error” in petitioners’ submission was its disregard of 
“the duty of a court of appeals to follow the precedents of the 
Supreme Court until the Court itself chooses to expressly 
overrule them.”  396 F. 3d, at 1351.  We granted certiorari 
to undertake a fresh examination of the history of both the 
judicial  and  legislative  appraisals  of  tying  arrangements. 
545 U. S. 1127 (2005).  Our review is informed by extensive 
scholarly comment and a change in position by the adminis­
trative agencies charged with enforcement of the antitrust 
laws. 
II 
American courts ﬁrst encountered tying arrangements in 
the  course  of  patent  infringement  litigation.  See,  e. g., 
Heaton-Peninsular  Button-Fastener  Co.  v.  Eureka  Spe­
cialty Co., 77 F. 288 (CA6 1896).  Such a case came before 
this Court in Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1 (1912), in 
which, as in the case we decide today, unpatented ink was 
the product that was “tied” to the use of a patented product 
through  the  use  of  a  licensing  agreement.  Without  com­
menting on the tying arrangement, the Court held that use 
of a competitor’s ink in violation of a condition of the agree­
ment—that the rotary mimeograph “ ‘may be used only with 
the stencil, paper, ink and other supplies made by A. B. Dick 
Co.’ ”—constituted  infringement  of  the  patent  on  the  ma­
chine.  Id.,  at  25–26.  Chief  Justice  White  dissented,  ex­
plaining  his  disagreement  with  the  Court’s  approval  of  a 
practice  that  he  regarded  as an  “attempt  to  increase  the 
scope of the monopoly granted by a patent . . . which tend[s] 
to increase monopoly and to burden the public in the exercise 
of their common rights.”  Id., at 70.  Two years later, Con­
