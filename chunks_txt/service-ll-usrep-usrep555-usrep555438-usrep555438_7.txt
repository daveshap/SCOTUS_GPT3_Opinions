456  PACIFIC BELL TELEPHONE CO. v. LINKLINE
 
COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
 
Opinion of the Court
 
Court of Appeals addressed only AT&T’s motion for judg­
ment on the pleadings on the plaintiffs’ original complaint.4 
For the reasons stated, we hold that the price-squeeze claims 
set  forth  in  that  complaint  are  not  cognizable  under  the 
Sherman Act. 
Plaintiffs have also ﬁled an amended complaint, and the 
District Court concluded that this complaint, generously con­
strued,  could  be  read  as  alleging  conduct  that  met  the 
Brooke Group requirements for predatory pricing.  App. to 
Pet. for Cert. 47a–52a, 56a.  That order, however, applied 
the “no set of facts” pleading standard that we have since 
rejected as too lenient.  See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 
550 U. S. 544, 561–563 (2007).  It is for the District Court on 
remand to consider whether the amended complaint states a 
claim upon which relief may be granted in light of the new 
pleading standard we articulated in Twombly, whether plain­
tiffs should be given leave to amend their complaint to bring 
a claim under Brooke Group, and such other matters prop­
erly before it.  Even if the amended complaint is further 
amended to add a Brooke Group claim, it may not survive a 
motion to dismiss.  For if AT&T can bankrupt the plaintiffs 
by refusing to deal altogether, the plaintiffs must demon­
strate why the law prevents AT&T from putting them out of 
4 We note a procedural irregularity with this case: Normally, an amended 
complaint  supersedes  the  original  complaint.  See  6  C.  Wright  &  A. 
Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure §1476, pp. 556–557 (2d ed. 1990). 
Here, the District Court addressed the amended complaint in its 2005 
order, App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a–52a, but the court only certiﬁed its 2004 
order—addressing the original complaint—for interlocutory appeal, id., 
at 56a–57a.  Both parties, as well as the Solicitor General, have expressed 
confusion about whether the amended complaint and the 2005 order are 
properly before this Court.  See Brief for Petitioners 9, n. 6 (noting “some 
ambiguity” about which order was certiﬁed); Brief for United States as 
Amicus Curiae  17 (“[I]t is unclear  whether the 2005 Order  and the 
amended complaint are properly at issue in this interlocutory appeal”); 
Brief for Respondents 8–10.  The Court of Appeals majority did not ad­
dress any of the District Court’s holdings from the 2005 order, so we de­
cline to consider those issues at this time.

business by pricing them out of the market.  Nevertheless, 
such questions are for the District Court to decide in the 
ﬁrst instance.  We do not address these issues here, as they 
are outside the scope of the question presented and were not 
addressed by the Court of Appeals in the decision below.

Trinko holds that a defendant with no antitrust duty to 
deal with its rivals has no duty to deal under the terms and 
conditions preferred by those rivals.  540 U. S., at 409–410. 
Brooke  Group  holds  that  low  prices  are  only  actionable 
under the Sherman Act when the prices are below cost and 
there is a dangerous probability that the predator will be 
able to recoup the proﬁts it loses from the low prices.  509 
U. S., at 222–224.  In this case, plaintiffs have not stated a 
duty-to-deal claim under Trinko and have not stated a preda­
tory pricing claim under Brooke Group.  They have none­
theless tried to join a wholesale claim that cannot succeed 
with a retail claim that cannot succeed, and alchemize them 
into a new form of antitrust liability never before recognized 
by this Court.  We decline the invitation to recognize such 
claims.  Two wrong claims do not make one that is right. 
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and 
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with 
this opinion. 
It is so ordered.

Souter,  and  Justice  Ginsburg  join,  concurring  in  the 
judgment. 
I would accept respondents’ concession that the Ninth Cir­
cuit majority’s “price squeeze” holding is wrong, I would va­
cate the Circuit’s decision, and I would remand the case in 
order to allow the District Court to determine whether re­
spondents may proceed with their “predatory pricing” claim

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
 
as set forth in Judge Gould’s dissenting Ninth Circuit opin­
ion.  linkLine  Communications,  Inc.  v.  SBC  California, 
Inc., 503 F. 3d 876, 887 (2007). 
A “price squeeze” claim ﬁnds its natural home in a Sher­
man Act § 2 monopolization case where the Government as 
plaintiff seeks to show that a defendant’s monopoly power 
rests, not upon “skill, foresight and industry,” United States 
v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F. 2d 416, 430 (CA2 1945) 
(Alcoa),  but  upon  exclusionary  conduct,  United  States  v. 
Grinnell  Corp.,  384  U. S.  563,  576  (1966).  As  this  Court 
pointed out in Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Ofﬁces 
of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U. S. 398 (2004), the “ ‘means 
of illicit exclusion, like the means of legitimate competition, 
are myriad.’ ”  Id., at 414 (quoting United States v. Micro­
soft Corp., 253 F. 3d 34, 58 (CADC 2001) (en banc) (per cu­
riam)).  They may involve a “course of dealing” that, even 
if proﬁtable, indicates a “willingness to forsake short-term 
proﬁts to achieve an anticompetitive end.”  Trinko, supra, 
at 409.  See, e. g., Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Ski­
ing Corp., 472 U. S. 585, 610–611 (1985); Complaint in United 
States v. International Business Machines Corp., Civil Ac­
tion No. 69 Civ. 200 (SDNY, ﬁled Jan. 17, 1969), ¶ 20(c), re­
printed in F. Fisher, J. McGowan, & J. Greenwood, Folded, 
Spindled,  and  Mutilated:  Economic  Analysis  and  U.  S.  v. 
IBM, App.  357 (1983).  And,  as Judge  Hand wrote  many 
years ago, a “price squeeze” may fall within that latter cate­
gory.  Alcoa, supra, at 437–438.  As a matter of logic, it 
may be that a particular price squeeze can only be exclusion­
ary if a refusal by the monopolist to sell to the “squeezed 
customer” would also be exclusionary.  But a court, faced 
with a price squeeze rather than a refusal to deal, is unlikely 
to ﬁnd the latter (hypothetical) question any easier to answer 
than the former. 
I would try neither to answer these hypothetical questions 
here nor to foreshadow their answer.  We have before us a 
regulated ﬁrm.  During the time covered by the complaint,
