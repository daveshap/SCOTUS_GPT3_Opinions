Opinion of the Court 
those  of  vertical  price  restraints;  both  reduce  intrabrand 
competition and can stimulate retailer services.  See, e. g., 
Business Electronics, supra, at 728; Monsanto, supra, at 
762–763; see also Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae 17– 
18.  Cf. Scherer & Ross 560 (noting that vertical nonprice 
restraints “can engender inefﬁciencies at least as serious as 
those imposed upon the consumer by resale price mainte­
nance”); Steiner, How Manufacturers Deal with the Price-
Cutting Retailer: When Are Vertical Restraints Efﬁcient? 
65 Antitrust L. J. 407, 446–447 (1997) (indicating that “anti­
trust  law  should  recognize  that  the  consumer  interest  is 
often better served by [resale price maintenance]—contrary 
to its per se illegality and the rule-of-reason status of verti­
cal nonprice restraints”).  The same legal standard (per se 
unlawfulness) applies to horizontal market division and hori­
zontal price ﬁxing because both have similar economic effect. 
There  is  likewise  little  economic  justiﬁcation  for  the  cur­
rent  differential  treatment  of  vertical  price  and  nonprice 
restraints.  Furthermore, vertical nonprice restraints may 
prove less efﬁcient for inducing desired services, and they 
reduce intrabrand competition more than vertical price re­
straints by eliminating both price and service competition. 
See Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae 17–18. 
In sum, it is a ﬂawed antitrust doctrine that serves the 
interests of lawyers—by creating legal distinctions that op­
erate as traps for the unwary—more than the interests of 
consumers—by requiring manufacturers to choose second­
best options to achieve sound business objectives. 
B 
Respondent’s arguments for reafﬁrming Dr. Miles on the 
basis of stare decisis do not require a different result.  Re­
spondent looks to congressional action concerning vertical 
price  restraints.  In  1937,  Congress  passed  the  Miller-
Tydings Fair Trade Act, 50 Stat. 693, which made vertical 
price  restraints  legal  if  authorized  by  a  fair  trade  law

Opinion of the Court 
enacted by a State.  Fifteen years later, Congress expanded 
the exemption to permit vertical price-setting agreements 
between a manufacturer  and a distributor to  be enforced 
against  other  distributors  not  involved  in  the  agreement. 
McGuire Act, 66 Stat. 632.  In 1975, however, Congress re­
pealed both Acts.  Consumer Goods Pricing Act, 89 Stat. 
801.  That the Dr. Miles rule applied to vertical price re­
straints in 1975, according to respondent, shows Congress 
ratiﬁed the rule. 
This is not so.  The text of the Consumer Goods Pricing 
Act did not codify the rule of per se illegality for vertical 
price  restraints.  It  rescinded  statutory  provisions  that 
made them per se legal.  Congress once again placed these 
restraints within the ambit of § 1 of the Sherman Act.  And, 
as has been discussed, Congress intended § 1 to give courts 
the ability “to develop governing principles of law” in the 
common-law  tradition.  Texas  Industries,  Inc.  v.  Radcliff 
Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 643 (1981); see Business Elec­
tronics, 485 U. S., at 731 (“The changing content of the term 
‘restraint of trade’ was well recognized at the time the Sher­
man Act was enacted”).  Congress could have set the Dr. 
Miles rule in stone, but it chose a more ﬂexible option.  We 
respect its decision by analyzing vertical price restraints, 
like all restraints, in conformance with traditional § 1 princi­
ples,  including  the  principle  that  our  antitrust  doctrines 
“evolv[e] with new circumstances and new wisdom.”  Busi­
ness Electronics, supra, at 732; see also Easterbrook 139. 
The rule of reason, furthermore, is not inconsistent with 
the Consumer Goods Pricing Act.  Unlike the earlier con­
gressional  exemption,  it  does  not  treat  vertical  price  re­
straints as per se legal.  In this respect, the justiﬁcations 
for the prior exemption are illuminating.  Its goal “was to 
allow the States to protect small retail establishments that 
Congress thought might otherwise be driven from the mar­
ketplace by large-volume discounters.”  California Retail 
Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S.

906  LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v. 
PSKS, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
97, 102 (1980).  The state fair trade laws also appear to have 
been justiﬁed  on similar grounds.  See Areeda  & Hoven­
kamp 298.  The rationales for these provisions are foreign to 
the Sherman Act.  Divorced from competition and consumer 
welfare, they were designed to save inefﬁcient small retail­
ers from their inability to compete.  The purpose of the anti­
trust laws, by contrast, is “the protection of competition, not 
competitors.”  Atlantic  Richﬁeld  Co.  v.  USA  Petroleum 
Co., 495 U. S. 328, 338 (1990) (internal quotation marks omit­
ted).  To the extent Congress repealed the exemption for 
some vertical price restraints to end its prior practice of en­
couraging anticompetitive conduct, the rule of reason pro­
motes the same objective. 
Respondent also relies on several congressional appropria­
tions in the mid-1980’s in which Congress did not permit the 
Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to 
use funds to advocate overturning Dr. Miles.  See, e. g., 97 
Stat. 1071.  We need not pause long in addressing this argu­
ment.  The conditions on funding are no longer in place, see, 
e. g., Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21, and they 
were ambiguous at best.  As much as they might show con­
gressional approval for Dr. Miles, they might demonstrate a 
different proposition: that Congress could not pass legisla­
tion codifying the rule and reached a short-term compro­
mise instead. 
Reliance interests do not require us to reafﬁrm Dr. Miles. 
To be sure, reliance on a judicial opinion is a signiﬁcant rea­
son to adhere to it, Payne v.  Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 
(1991), especially “in cases involving property and contract 
rights,” Khan, 522 U. S., at 20.  The reliance interests here, 
however, like the reliance interests in Khan, cannot justify 
an inefﬁcient rule, especially because the narrowness of the 
rule has allowed manufacturers to set minimum resale prices 
in other ways.  And while the Dr. Miles rule is longstand­
ing, resale price maintenance was legal under fair trade laws
