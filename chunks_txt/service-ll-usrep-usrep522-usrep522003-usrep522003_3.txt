Opinion of the Court
The District Court found that the allegations in the com-
plaint did not state a per se violation of the Sherman  Act
because they did not establish the sort of "manifestly anti-
competitive implications or pernicious effect on competition"
that would justify per se prohibition  of State Oil's conduct.
App.  43-44.  Subsequently, in ruling  on  cross-motions  for
summary judgment, the  District Court concluded  that re-
spondents had failed to demonstrate antitrust injury or harm
to  competition.  App.  to Pet. for  Cert. 37a.  The  District
Court held that respondents had not shown that a difference
in gasoline pricing would have increased the station's sales;
nor had they shown that State Oil had market power or that
its pricing provisions affected competition in a relevant mar-
ket.  Id., at 37a, 40a.  Accordingly, the District  Court en-
tered summary judgment for State Oil on respondents' Sher-
man Act claim.  Id., at 40a.
The  Court of Appeals  for the Seventh  Circuit reversed.
93 F. 3d 1358 (1996).  The  court first noted that the agree-
ment between respondents and State Oil did indeed fix maxi-
mum gasoline prices by making it "worthless" for respond-
ents  to  exceed  the  suggested  retail prices.  Id.,  at  1360.
After reviewing legal and economic  aspects of price fixing,
the court concluded that State Oil's pricing scheme was a per
se antitrust violation under Albrecht v. Herald Co.,  supra.
Although  the  Court  of Appeals  characterized  Albrecht as
"unsound when  decided"  and "inconsistent  with later deci-
sions" of this Court, it felt constrained to follow that decision.
93 F. 3d, at 1363.  In light of Albrecht and Atlantic Richfield
Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328 (1990) (ARCO), the
court found that respondents  could have suffered  antitrust
injury from not being able to adjust gasoline prices.
We granted certiorari to consider two questions, whether
State Oil's conduct constitutes a per se violation of the Sher-
man Act and  whether respondents  are  entitled to recover
damages based on that conduct.  519 U. S. 1107 (1997).

STATE OIL CO. v. KHAN
Opinion of the Court
II
A
Although the Sherman Act, by its terms, prohibits every
agreement "in restraint of trade," this Court has long recog-
nized  that Congress  intended  to outlaw  only unreasonable
restraints.  See, e. g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical
Soc.,  457  U. S.  332, 342-343  (1982)  (citing United States v.
Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U. S. 505 (1898)).  As a consequence,
most antitrust claims are analyzed under a "rule of reason,"
according to which  the finder  of fact must decide  whether
the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on
competition, taking into account a variety of factors, includ-
ing specific information about the relevant business, its con-
dition before and  after the restraint was  imposed, and the
restraint's history, nature, and effect.  457 U. S., at 343, and
n. 13 (citing Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246
U. S. 231, 238 (1918)).
Some types of restraints, however, have such predictable
and pernicious  anticompetitive  effect,  and  such limited po-
tential for procompetitive benefit, that they are deemed un-
lawful per se.  Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356
U. S. 1, 5 (1958).  Per se treatment is appropriate "[olnce ex-
perience with a particular kind of restraint enables the Court
to predict with confidence that the rule of reason will con-
demn it."  Maricopa County, supra, at 344; see also Broad-
cast Music, Inc. v. Columbia BroadcastingS ystem, Inc., 441
U. S. 1, 19, n. 33 (1979).  Thus, we have expressed reluctance
to adopt per se rules with regard to "restraints imposed in
the context of business relationships where the economic im-
pact of certain practices is not immediately obvious."  FTC
v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476  U. S. 447,  458-459
(1986).
A review of this Court's decisions leading up to and beyond
Albrecht is relevant to our assessment of the continuing va-
lidity of the per se rule established in Albrecht.  Beginning

Opinion of the Court
with Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co.,
220 U. S. 373  (1911),  the Court recognized the illegality of
agreements under which manufacturers or suppliers set the
minimum resale prices to be charged by their distributors.
By 1940,  the Court broadly declared  all business combina-
tions "formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising,
depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a com-
modity  in  interstate  or foreign  commerce"  illegal  per se.
United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 223
(1940).  Accordingly,  the  Court  condemned  an  agreement
between two affiliated liquor distillers to limit the maximum
price  charged  by retailers in Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph
E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340  U. S. 211  (1951),  noting that
agreements to fix maximum prices, "no less than those to fix
minimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders and thereby
restrain  their ability to  sell in accordance  with  their  own
judgment."  Id., at 213.
In subsequent cases,  the Court's attention  turned to ar-
rangements through which suppliers imposed restrictions on
dealers with respect to matters other than resale price.  In
White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U. S. 253 (1963),  the
Court considered the validity of a manufacturer's assignment
of exclusive territories to its distributors and dealers.  The
Court determined that too little was known about the com-
petitive impact of such vertical limitations to warrant treat-
ing them as per se unlawful.  Id., at 263.  Four years later,
in  United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co.,  388 U. S.  365
(1967), the Court reconsidered the status of exclusive dealer
territories and held that, upon the transfer of title to goods
to a distributor, a supplier's imposition of territorial restric-
tions  on  the  distributor  was  "so  obviously  destructive  of
competition"  as to constitute a per se violation of the Sher-
man Act.  Id., at 379.  In Schwinn, the Court acknowledged
that some vertical restrictions, such as the conferral of terri-
torial rights or franchises, could have procompetitive bene-
fits  by allowing  smaller  enterprises  to compete,  and  that
