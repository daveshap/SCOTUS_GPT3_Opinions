HARTFORD FIRE INS. CO. v. CALIFORNIA
Opinion of the Court
(Cal. Complaint 1 84).  After ISO got regulatory approval of
the 1986  forms in most States  where approval  was needed,
it eliminated  its support  services  for  the 1973  CGL  form,
thus rendering it impossible for most ISO members to con-
tinue to use the form.  Id., at 32-33  (Cal. Complaint 1i  97,
99).
The  Fifth Claim  for  Relief in  the  California  Complaint,
id., at 43-44 (11 131-135),  and the virtually identical  Third
Claim for Relief in the Connecticut  Complaint, id., at 92-94
(  125-129), charge a conspiracy among a group of London
reinsurers  and  brokers  to  coerce  primary  insurers  in  the
United States to offer CGL coverage only on a claims-made
basis.  The  reinsurers  collectively  refused  to  write  new
reinsurance  contracts  for,  or  to  renew  longstanding  con-
tracts with, "primary... insurers unless they were prepared
to switch from the occurrence to the claims.-made form," id.,
at 30 (Cal. Complaint 1 88); they also amended their reinsur-
ance contracts  to cover only claims made before a  "'sunset
date,"' thus eliminating reinsurance  for claims made on oc-
currence  policies  after that date, id., at 31  (Cal. Complaint
11 90-92).
The Sixth Claim for Relief in the California Complaint, id.,
at 45-46 (11 136-140), and the nearly identical Fourth Claim
for  Relief  in  the  Connecticut  Complaint,  id.,  at  94-95
(1  130-134),  charge another  conspiracy among a somewhat
different group of London reinsurers to withhold reinsurance
for  pollution  coverage.  The  London  reinsurers  met  and
agreed that all reinsurance contracts covering North Ameri-
can casualty  risks, including  CGL  risks,  would  be  written
with  a  complete  exclusion  for  pollution  liability  coverage.
Id., at 32 (Cal. Complaint TT 94-95).  In accordance with this
agreement, the parties have in fact excluded pollution liabil-
ity coverage from CGL reinsurance  contracts  since at least
late 1985.  Ibid. (Cal. Complaint 1 94).

The Seventh Claim for Relief in the California Complaint,
id., at 46-47 (  141-145), and the closely similar Sixth Claim
for Relief in the Connecticut Complaint, id., at 97-98 (  140-
144),  charge a group of domestic primary insurers, foreign
reinsurers, and the ISO with conspiring to restrain trade in
the markets for "excess" and "umbrella" insurance by draft-
ing model forms and policy language for these types of insur-
ance, which  are  not normally offered  on a  regulated  basis.
Id., at 33 (Cal. Complaint 1 101).  The ISO Executive  Com-
mittee eventually  released  standard  language  for both "oc-
currence"  and  "claims-made"  umbrella  and  excess  policies;
that language included a retroactive date in the claims-made
version, and an  absolute pollution exclusion  and a legal de-
fense cost cap in both versions.  Id., at 34 (Cal. Complaint
105).
Finally, the Eighth Claim for Relief in the California Com-
plaint, id., at 47-49 (T  146-150), and its counterpart in the
Fifth Claim for Relief in the Connecticut  Complaint, id., at
95-97  (11 135-139), charge a group of London and domestic
retrocessional reinsurers I with conspiring to withhold retro-
cessional reinsurance for North American seepage, pollution,
and property contamination risks.  Those retrocessional re-
insurers signed, and have implemented, an agreement to use
their "'best  endeavors"' to ensure that they would provide
such reinsurance for North American risks "'only...  where
the original business includes a seepage and pollution exclu-
5The California and Connecticut Complaints' Statements of Facts de-
scribe this conspiracy as involving "[slpecialized reinsurers in London and
the United  States."  App. 34 (1 106); id., at 87 (Conn. Complaint  110).
The claims for relief, however, name only London reinsurers; they do not
name any of the domestic defendants who are the petitioners in No. 91-
1111.  See id., at 48 (  147); id., at 96 (Conn. Complaint  136).  Thus, we
assume that the domestic reinsurers alleged to be involved in this conspir-
acy  are  among  the  "unnamed  co-conspirators"  mentioned  in  the  com-
plaints.  See id., at 48 (Cal. Complaint  147); id., at 96 (Conn. Complaint
136).

sion wherever legal and applicable."'  Id., at 35 (Cal. Com-
plaint  108).6
C
Nineteen  States  and a  number  of private  plaintiffs  filed
36 complaints against the insurers involved in this course of
events, charging  that the conspiracies  described  above vio-
lated § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 1.  After the ac-
tions had  been  consolidated  for litigation  in  the Northern
District of California, the defendants  moved to  dismiss for
failure to state a  cause of action,  or, in the alternative, for
summary judgment.  The  District  Court  granted  the mo-
tions to dismiss.  In re Insurance Antitrust Litigation,7 23
F. Supp. 464  (1989).  It held  that  the conduct  alleged  fell
within the grant of antitrust immunity contained in § 2(b) of
the McCarran-Ferguson  Act, 15 U. S. C. § 1012(b), because it
amounted to "the business of insurance" and was "regulated
by State Law" within the meaning of that section; none of
the  conduct,  in  the  District  Court's  view, amounted  to a
"boycott" within the meaning of the § 3(b) exception to that
grant  of  immunity.  15  U. S. C.  § 1013(b).  The  District
Court also dismissed the three claims that named only cer-
tain London-based  defendants,7 invoking international com-
ity and applying the Ninth Circuit's decision in Timberlane
Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, N. T  & S. A.,  549  F. 2d
597 (1976).
The  Court  of Appeals  reversed.  In re Insurance Anti-
trust Litigation, 938 F. 2d 919 (CA9 1991).  Although it held
the conduct involved to be "the business of insurance" within
the meaning of § 2(b), it concluded  that the defendants  could
