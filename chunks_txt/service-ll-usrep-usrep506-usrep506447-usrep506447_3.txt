Opinion of the Court
attempt to monopolize was likely to succeed it was not neces-
sary  to present  evidence  of the relevant  market  or of the
defendants'  market power.  In  so doing, the Ninth Circuit
relied on Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327  F. 2d 459  (CA9),
cert. denied, 377 U. S. 993 (1964),  and its progeny.  App. to
Pet. for Cert. A18-A19.  The Court of Appeals noted that
these cases,  in dealing with attempt to monopolize  claims,
had ruled that "if evidence of unfair or predatory conduct is
presented, it may satisfy both the specific intent and danger-
ous probability elements of the offense, without any proof of
relevant market or the defendant's marketpower [sic]."  Id.,
at A19.  If, however, there is insufficient evidence of unfair
or predatory conduct, there must be a showing of "relevant
market or the defendant's marketpower [sic]."  Ibid.  The
court went on to find:
"There  is  sufficient  evidence  from  which  the jury
could conclude that the S. I. Group and Spectrum Group
engaged  in  unfair  or  predatory  conduct  and  thus  in-
ferred that they had the specific intent and the danger-
ous probability of success and, therefore, McQuillan  did
not have to  prove  relevant  market  or the  defendant's
marketing power."  Id., at A21.
The  decision  below, and  the Lessig line  of decisions  on
which it relies, conflicts with holdings of courts in other Cir-
cuits.  Every  other  Court  of  Appeals  has  indicated  that
proving an attempt to monopolize requires proof of a danger-
ous probability of monopolization of a relevant market.5  We

Opinion of the Court
granted  certiorari, 503 U. S.  958 (1992),  to resolve  this con-
flict among the Circuits.6  We reverse.
II
While § 1 of the Sherman Act forbids contracts or conspira-
cies in restraint of trade or commerce, § 2 addresses the ac-
tions of single firms that monopolize or attempt to monopo-
lize, as well as conspiracies and combinations to monopolize.
Section 2 does not define  the elements of the offense of at-
tempted monopolization.  Nor is there much guidance  to be
had  in the scant legislative  history of that provision, which
was added late in the legislative process.  See 1 E. Kintner,
Legislative History of the Federal Antitrust Laws and Re-
lated Statutes 23-25 (1978);  3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Anti-
trust Law  617, pp. 39-41  (1978).  The  legislative history
does indicate that much of the interpretation of the necessar-
ily broad principles of the Act was  to be left for the courts
in  particular  cases.  See,  e. g.,  21  Cong.  Rec.  2460  (1890)
(statement of Sen. Sherman).  See also 1 Kintner, supra, at
19; 3 Areeda & Turner, supra,  617, at 40.
This Court first addressed the meaning of attempt to mo-
nopolize under § 2 in Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S.
375 (1905).  The Court's opinion, written by Justice Holmes,
contained the following passage:
tries Corp. v. Hartz Mountain Corp., 810 F. 2d 795, 804 (CA8 1987); Colo-
rado Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America, 885 F. 2d
683, 693 (CA10 1989), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 972 (1990); Key Enterprises
of Delaware, Inc. v. Venice Hospital, 919 F. 2d 1550, 1565 (CAll 1990);
Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co., 252 U. S. App. D. C. 11, 15-16, 786 F. 2d
424, 428-429, cert. denied, 479  U. S.  851  (1986);  Abbott Laboratories v.
Brennan, 952  F. 2d  1346,  1354  (CA Fed.  1991),  cert. denied, 505  U. S.
1205 (1992).
" Our grant of certiorari was limited to the first question presented in
the petition: "Whether a manufacturer's  distributor expressly absolved of
violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act can, without any evidence of mar-
ket power or specific intent, be found liable for attempting to monopolize
solely by virtue of a unique Ninth Circuit rule?"  Pet. for Cert. i.

Opinion of the Court
"Where acts are not sufficient in themselves to produce
a  result which  the law seeks  to prevent-for instance,
the monopoly-but  require  further acts  in  addition  to
the mere forces  of nature to bring that result to pass,
an  intent  to  bring it to pass  is  necessary  in  order to
produce  a  dangerous  probability  that  it  will  happen.
Commonwealth v. Peaslee, 177  Massachusetts  267, 272
[59 N. E. 55, 56 (1901)].  But when that intent and the
consequent dangerous probability exist, this statute, like
many  others  and  like the  common  law  in some  cases,
directs itself against that dangerous  probability as well
as against the completed result."  Id., at 396.
The  Court went on to explain,  however, that not every act
done with intent to produce an unlawful result constitutes an
attempt.  "It is a question of proximity and degree."  Id., at
402.  Swift thus indicated that intent is necessary, but alone
is not sufficient, to establish the dangerous probability of suc-
cess that is the object of § 2's prohibition of attempts.7
The  Court's decisions  since Swift have reflected the view
that  the plaintiff charging  attempted  monopolization  must
prove  a  dangerous  probability  of  actual  monopolization,
which  has  generally  required  a  definition  of the  relevant
market and examination of market power.  In Walker Proc-
ess Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp.,
382  U. S.  172,  177  (1965),  we  found  that  enforcement  of a
fraudulently  obtained  patent  claim  could  violate  the Sher-
man Act.  We stated that, to establish monopolization or at-
tempt to monopolize under § 2 of the Sherman Act, it would
7Justice Holmes confirmed  that this was his interpretation of Swift in
Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347 (1912).  In dissenting in that case on
other grounds, the Justice, citing Swift, stated that an attempt may be
found where the danger of harm  is very great; however, "combination,
intention and overt act may all be present without amounting to a criminal
attempt ....  There must be dangerous proximity to success."  225 U. S.,
at 387-388.
