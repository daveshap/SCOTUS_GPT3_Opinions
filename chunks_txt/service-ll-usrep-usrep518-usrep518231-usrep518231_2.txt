BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.
Opinion of the Court
football players  brought this antitrust suit against football
club owners.  The club owners had bargained with the play-
ers'  union  over a  wage  issue  until they reached  impasse.
The owners then had agreed among themselves (but not with
the union)  to implement  the terms  of their own last best
bargaining offer.  The question before us is whether federal
labor laws shield  such an agreement from  antitrust attack.
We believe that they do.  This Court has previously found
in the labor laws an implicit antitrust exemption that applies
where  needed  to  make  the  collective-bargaining  process
work.  Like  the  Court  of Appeals,  we  conclude  that this
need makes the exemption applicable in this case.
We  can  state  the  relevant  facts  briefly.  In  1987,  a
collective-bargaining agreement between the National Foot-
ball League (NFL or League), a group of football clubs, and
the NFL Players Association,  a labor union, expired.  The
NFL and the Players Association began to negotiate a new
contract.  In March 1989, during the negotiations, the NFL
adopted Resolution G-2, a plan that would permit each club
to establish a "developmental squad" of up to six rookie or
"first-year" players who, as free agents, had failed to secure
a position on a regular player roster.  See App. 42.  Squad
members  would  play in practice  games and  sometimes  in
regular games as  substitutes for injured players.  Resolu-
tion G-2 provided that the club owners would pay all squad
members the same weekly salary.
The next month, April, the NFL presented the develop-
mental  squad  plan  to the  Players  Association.  The NFL
proposed  a squad player  salary  of $1,000  per week.  The
Players  Association  disagreed.  It  insisted  that  the  club
owners give developmental  squad players benefits and pro-
tections similar to those provided regular players, and that
they leave individual squad members free to negotiate their
own salaries.

Opinion of the Court
Two months later, in June, negotiations on the issue of de-
velopmental squad salaries reached an impasse.  The NFL
then unilaterally implemented the developmental squad pro-
gram by distributing to the clubs  a  uniform  contract  that
embodied the terms of Resolution G-2  and the $1,000  pro-
posed weekly salary.  The League advised club owners that
paying developmental squad players more or less than $1,000
per week would  result in disciplinary  action, including the
loss of draft choices.
In May  1990,  235  developmental  squad players  brought
this antitrust suit against the League and its member clubs.
The players claimed that their employers' agreement to pay
them a $1,000 weekly salary violated the Sherman Act.  See
15 U. S. C. § 1 (forbidding agreements in restraint of trade).
The  Federal District Court denied  the employers'  claim  of
exemption from the antitrust laws; it permitted the case to
reach the jury; and it subsequently  entered judgment on a
jury treble-damages award that exceeded $30 million.  The
NFL and its member clubs appealed.
The  Court of Appeals  (by a  split 2-to-1  vote) reversed.
The majority interpreted the labor laws  as "waiv[ing] anti-
trust liability for restraints on competition imposed through
the collective-bargaining process,  so long as such restraints
operate primarily in a labor market characterized  by collec-
tive bargaining."  50 F. 3d 1041,  1056  (CADC 1995).  The
court held, consequently, that the club owners were immune
from  antitrust  liability.  We  granted  certiorari  to  review
that determination.  Although we do not interpret the ex-
emption as broadly as did the Appeals Court, we nonetheless
find the exemption applicable, and we affirm that court's im-
munity conclusion.

The immunity before us rests upon what this Court has
called the "nonstatutory" labor exemption from the antitrust
laws.  Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers, 421  U. S. 616, 622

(1965);  Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381  U. S.  657 (1965).
The  Court  has implied  this  exemption  from  federal  labor
statutes, which set forth a national labor policy favoring free
and private collective bargaining, see 29 U. S. C. § 151; Tedm-
sters v. Oliver, 858 U. S. 283, 295 (1959); which require good-
faith bargaining over wages, hours, and working conditions,
see 29 U. S. C. §§ 158(a)(5),  158(d); NLRB v. Wooster Div. of
Borg-Warner Corp., 356 U. S. 342, 348-349 (1958); and which
delegate  related  rulemaking  and  interpretive  authority  to
the National Labor Relations Board (Board), see 29'U. S. C.
§ 153; San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359
U. S. 236, 242-245 (1959).
This  implicit  exemption  reflects  both history  and  logic.
As a matter of history, Congress intended the labor statutes
(from which the Court has implied the exemption) in part to
adopt the views of dissenting Justices  in Duplex Printing
Press Co. v. Deering,2 54 U. S. 443 (1921), which Justices had
urged the  Court  to  interpret  broadly  a  different  explicit
"statutory" labor exemption that Congress earlier (in 1914)
had written directly into the antitrust laws.  Id., at 483-488
(Brandeis, J., joined by  Holmes and  Clarke, JJ., dissenting)
(interpreting § 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 738, 29 U. S. C.
§ 52); see also United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219, 230-
236 (1941)  (discussing congressional reaction to Duplex).  In
the 1930's, when it subsequently enacted the labor statutes,
Congress,  as in  1914, hoped to prevent judicial use of anti-
trust law to resolve labor disputes-a kind of dispute  nor-
mally inappropriate for antitrust law resolution.  See Jewel
Tea,  supra, at  700-709  (opinion  of  Goldberg,  J.);  Marine
Cooks v. PanamaS . S. Co., 362 U. S. 365, 370, n. 7 (1960); A.
Cox, Law and the National Labor Policy 3-8 (1960); cf. Du-
plex, supra, at 485 (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (explicit "statu-
tory" labor exemption reflected view that "Congress, not the
judges, was the body which should declare what public policy
in regard to the industrial struggle demands").  The implicit
("nonstatutory") exemption interprets the labor statutes in
