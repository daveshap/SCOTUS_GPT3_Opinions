STEVENS, J., dissenting
with B&W's net prices to distributors lower than Liggett's.6
B&W's deep discounts not only forfeited all of its $48.7 mil-
lion in projected trading profits for the next 18 months, but
actually  resulted  in  sales  below  B&W's  average  variable
cost.  Id., at 338-339.
Assessing the pre-July 1984 evidence tending to prove that
B&W was motivated  by anticompetitive intent, the District
Court observed  that the documentary  evidence was  "more
voluminous and detailed than any other reported case.  This
evidence not only indicates B&W wanted to injure Liggett,
it  also  details  an  extensive  plan  to  slow  the  growth  of
the  generic  cigarette  segment."  Liggett  Group, Inc.  v.
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 748 F. Supp. 344, 354
(MDNC 1990).
The 18-Month Price War
The  volume  rebates  offered  by  B&W to  its wholesalers
during the 18-month period from July 1984 to December 1985
unquestionably  constituted  price discrimination  covered  by
ยง 2(a)  of the Clayton  Act, 38 Stat. 730,  as amended  by the
Robinson-Patman  Act,  49  Stat.  1526,  15  U. S. C.  ยง 13(a).7
Nor were the discounts justified by any statutory or affirma-
tive defense:  They were not cost justified,8 App.  525, were
6O  n June 4, 1984, B&W announced a maximum rebate of $0.30 per car-
ton for purchases of over 8,000 cases per quarter; a week later, Liggett
announced a rebate of $0.20 on comparable volumes.  On June 21,  B&W
increased its rebate to $0.50, and a day later, Liggett went to $0.43.  After
three more increases, B&W settled at $0.80 per carton, while Liggett re-
mained at $0.73.  See App. 327, 420-421.
7That quantity discounts are covered by the Act, and prohibited  when
they have the requisite effect on competition, has been firmly established
since our decision in FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S.3 7, 42-44 (1948).
8"Provided, That nothing herein contained  shall prevent differentials
which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture,
sale, or delivery  resulting from  the differing  methods  or quantities in
which  such  commodities  are  to  such  purchasers  sold  or  delivered."

not good-faith efforts to meet the equally low price of a com-
petitor,9 and were not mere introductory or promotional dis-
counts, 91 Tr. 42.
The rebate program was intended to harm Liggett and in
fact caused it serious injury.10  The jury found that Liggett
had  suffered  actual  damages  of $49.6  million,  App. 28,  an
amount close to, but slightly  larger than, the $48.7 million
trading profit B&W had indicated it would forgo in order to
discipline Liggett.  See supra, at 247.  To inflict this injury,
B&W sustained a substantial loss.  During the full 18-month
period, B&W's revenues ran consistently below its total vari-
able costs, with an average deficiency of approximately $0.30
per carton and a total loss on B&W black and whites of al-
most  $15  million.  App.  338-339.  That  B&W  executives
were willing to accept losses of this magnitude during the
entire  18  months is powerful  evidence  of their belief that
prices ultimately could be "managed up" to a level that would
allow B&W to recoup its investment.
The Aftermath
At the end of 1985, the list price of branded cigarettes was
$33.15  per carton,  and  the  list price  of black and  whites,
$19.75 per carton.  App. 325.  Over the next four years, the
list price  on both  branded  and black and  white  cigarettes
9"Provided, however, That nothing  herein  contained shall  prevent a
seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower
price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchas-
ers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor,
or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor."  ยง 13(b).
The jury gave a negative answer to the following special issue:
"3.  Did Brown  & Williamson  engage  in price discrimination  in good
faith with the intention to meet, but not beat, the equally low net prices
of Liggett Group, Inc.?"  App. 27-28.
1o By offering its largest discounts  to  Liggett's 14 largest  customers,
App. 168-169, 174, B&W not only put its "money where the volume is,"
id., at 402, but also applied maximum pressure to Liggett at a lesser cost
to itself than would have resulted from a nondiscriminatory price cut.

increased twice a year, by identical amounts.  The June 1989
increases brought the price  of branded  cigarettes  to $46.15
per carton, and the price of black and whites to $33.75-an
amount  even  higher than  the price  for branded  cigarettes
when the  war ended  in  December  1985.  Ibid."  Because
the rate of increase  was  higher on  black  and  whites  than
on brandeds, the price differential between the two types of
cigarettes narrowed, ibid., from roughly 40% in 1985 to 27%
in 1989.  See 964 F. 2d, at 338.
The expert economist employed by  Liggett testified that
the post-1985 price increases were unwarranted by increases
in manufacturing  or other  costs, taxes,  or promotional  ex-
penditures.  App. 525.  To be sure, some portion of the vol-
ume rebates granted distributors was passed on to consum-
ers in the form of promotional activity, so that consumers did
not feel the full brunt of the price increases.  Nevertheless,
the record amply supports the conclusion that the post-1985
price  increases  in  list  prices  produced  higher  consumer
prices, as well as higher profits for the manufacturers.12
The legal question presented by this evidence  is whether
the facts as they existed during and at the close of the 18-
month period, and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from
1 It is also true that these same years, other major manufacturers en-
tered the generic market and expanded their generic sales.  Ante, at 217.
Their  entry is entirely consistent  with the possibility that  lockstep in-
creases in the price of generics brought them to a level that was supra-
competitive, though lower than that charged on branded cigarettes.
12 "Q Does this mean that the price increases, which you testified are
happening twice a year, are used up in these consumer promotions?
"A Not by any stretch of the imagination.  Although there has been an
increase in the use of this type of promotional activity over the last four
or five years, the increase in that promotional activity has been far out-
stripped by the list price increases.  The prices go up by a lot; the promo-
tional activity, indeed, does go up.  But the promotional activity has not
gone up by anywhere near the magnitude of the list price increases.  Fur-
ther, those price increases  are not warranted  by increasing costs, since
the manufacturing costs of making cigarettes have remained roughly con-
stant over the last five years."  App. 509.
