Opinion of the Court
While  the ified  rate  doctrine  may  seem harsh  in  some
circumstances,  see, e.g.,  Maislin Industries, U.S.,  Inc. v.
Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 130-131 (1990),  its strict
application  is  necessary  to  "prevent  carriers  from  inten-
tionally  'misquoting' rates to shippers as a means of offer-
ing them rebates or discounts,"  the very evil the filing re-
quirement seeks to prevent.  Id., at 127.  Regardless of the
carrier's motive-whether it seeks to benefit or harm a par-
ticular customer-the policy of nondiscriminatory rates is vi-
olated when similarly situated customers pay different rates
for the same services.  It is that antidiscriminatory policy
which lies at "the heart of the common-carrier section of the
Communications  Act."  MCI Telecommunications Corp. v.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., supra, at 229.
The  Ninth Circuit  thought the  filed  rate  doctrine  inap-
plicable "[b]ecause this case does not involve rates or rate-
setting, but rather involves the provisioning of services and
billing."  108  F. 3d,  at 990.  Rates, however, do not  exist
in isolation.  They have meaning only when one knows the
services to which they are attached.  Any claim for exces-
sive rates can be couched as a claim for inadequate services
and vice versa.  "If 'discrimination in charges' does not in-
clude non-price  features, then the carrier  could defeat the
broad purpose of the statute by the simple expedient of pro-
viding an additional benefit at no additional charge....  An
unreasonable 'discrimination in charges,' that is, can come in
the form of a lower price for an equivalent service or in the
form of an enhanced service for an equivalent price."  Com-
petitive Telecommunications Assn. v. FCC,9 98 F. 2d 1058,
1062  (CADC  1993).  The  Communications  Act  recognizes
this  when  it  requires  the  filed  tariff  to  show  not  only
"charges,"  but also "the classifications,  practices, and regu-
lations  affecting  such  charges,"  47  U. S. C.  § 203(a);  and
when it makes it unlawful to "extend to any person any privi-
leges or facilities in such  communication,  or employ or en-

Opinion of the Court
force  any  classifications,  regulations,  or practices  affecting
such  charges" except those set forth in the tariff, §203(c).
Unsurprisingly, the cases decided under the ICA make it
clear that discriminatory  "privileges" come in many guises,
and are not limited to discounted rates.  "[A]  preference  or
rebate is the necessary result of every violation of [the ana-
log to § 203(c) in the ICA] where the carrier renders or pays
for a service not covered by the prescribed tariffs."  United
States v. Wabash R. Co.,  321 U. S. 403, 412-413  (1944).  In
Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Kirby, 225  U. S.  155  (1912),  we
rejected a shipper's breach-of-contract  claim against a rail-
road for failure to ship a carload of race horses by a particu-
larly fast train.  We held- that the contract was invalid as a
matter of law because the carrier's tariffs "did not provide
for an expedited service, nor for transportation by any par-
ticular train," and therefore the shipper received "an undue
advantage ...  that is not one open  to others in the same
situation."  Id., at 163, 165.  Similarly, in Davis v. Cornwell,
264 U. S. 560 (1924), we invalidated the carrier's agreement
to provide the shipper with a number of railroad cars  on a
specified day; such a special advantage, we said, "is illegal,
when not provided for in the tariff."  Id., at 562.  See also
Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, supra, at 653;  Wight
v. United States, 167 U. S. 512, 517-518 (1897);  I. Lake, Dis-
crimination by Railroads and Other Public Utilities 310-315
(1947).
III
The  Ninth  Circuit  distinguished  the  Court's  filed  rate
cases involving claims for special services on the ground that
the services at issue there "should have been included in the
tariff  and  made  available  to  all"  because  "the  customer
would  have been  expected to pay a higher rate" for those
services.  108 F. 3d, at 989, n. 9.  But that is precisely the
case here.  Indeed, the additional services  and guarantees
that respondent claims it was  entitled to by virtue  of Ms.
Kisor's  representations  and  petitioner's  sales  brochures-

Opinion of the Court
viz.,  faster provisioning,  the allocation  of charges  through
multilocation billing, and various matters relating to depos-
its, calling cards, and service support, see 108 F. 3d, at 987-
988-all pertain to subjects that are specifically addressed
by the filed  tariff.  See  AT&T  Tariff FCC  No.  1, §2.5.10
(provisioning of orders); § 6.2.4 (allocation of charges); § 2.5.6
(deposits); § 2.5.12.B (calling cards); § 6.2.5 (service supports).
The  Ninth Circuit agreed that all of respondent's claims
except those relating to provisioning and billing would be
pre-empted if the ified rate doctrine applied.  108 F. 3d, at
990.  But even provisioning and billing are, in the relevant
sense,  "covered"  by the tariff.  For  example, whereas  re-
spondent asks to enforce a guarantee that orders would be
provisioned within 30 to 90 days, the tariff leaves it  up to
petitioner to "establis[h] and confir[m]"  a due date for provi-
sioning, requires that petitioner merely make "every reason-
able effort" to meet that due date, and if it  fails gives the
customer  no recourse  except to "cancel  the order  without
penalty or payment  of nonrecurring  charges."  §2.5.10(B).
Faster, guaranteed provisioning of orders for the same rate
is  certainly  a privilege  within  the  meaning  of 47  U. S. C.
§203(c)  and  the filed  rate doctrine.  Cf. Chicago & Alton
R. Co. v. Kirby, supra, at  163  (refusing to  enforce  prom-
ise for faster, guaranteed service not included in the tariff).
As for billing, whereas respondent claims that, pursuant to
the MLB  option, petitioner promised to allocate usage and
charges accurately  among respondent's customers, the tariff
provides  that  petitioner  "will  not  allocate  . . . usage  or
charges"  among  the  locations  on the  customer's  network
and "is not responsible for the way that the Customer may
allocate usage or charges."  AT&T Tariff FCC No. 1, § 6.2.4.
Any assurance by petitioner that it would allocate usage and
charges and take responsibility for the task would have been
in flat contradiction  of the tariff.  See Chesapeake & Ohio
R. Co. v. Westinghouse, Church, Kerr & Co.,  270 U. S. 260,
266 (1926).
