SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment
the Court that, construed in favor of the plaintiffs, the First,
Second, Third, and Fourth Claims for Relief in the California
Complaint, and the First and Second Claims for Relief in the
Connecticut  Complaint,  allege  one  or more  § 3(b) "act[s]  of
boycott," and are thus sufficient to survive a motion to dis-
miss.  See infra, at 789-790; post, at 811.
In  reviewing the motions to dismiss, however, the Court
has  decided  to use what  I  believe to  be  an  overly narrow
definition of the term "boycott" as used in § 3(b), confining it
to those refusals to deal that are "unrelated" or "collateral"
to  the objective sought by those refusing to deal.  Post, at
803.  I do  not believe  that the McCarran-Ferguson  Act or
our precedents warrant such a cramped reading of the term.
The  majority and  I find common  ground in four proposi-
tions concerning  § 3(b) boycotts, as established in our  deci-
sions in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U. S.
531 (1978), and United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters
Assn., 322 U. S. 533 (1944).  First, as we noted in St. Paul,
our only prior decision construing "boycott" as it appears in
§ 3(b), only those refusals  to deal involving the coordinated
action of multiple actors constitute § 3(b) boycotts: "conduct
by individual actors falling short of concerted activity is sim-
ply not a 'boycott' within [the meaning of] § 3(b)."  438 U. S.,
at 555;  see post, at 800  ("'boycott"' used "to  describe  ...
collective  action");  post, at  801  ("To  'boycott'  means  '[t]o
combine  in  refusing  to hold  relations"'  (citation  omitted)).
Second, a  § 3(b) boycott need not involve  an absolute re-
fusal to deal.13  A primary goal of the  alleged conspirators
in South-Eastern Underwriters,a s we described it, was "to
force  nonmember  insurance  companies  into  the  conspira-
cies." 14  322 U. S., at 535; cf. Joint Hearing on S. 1362, H. R.
13 Petitioners correctly concede this point.  See Brief for Petitioners in
No. 91-1111, p. 32, n. 14.
14 As we have noted before, see Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal
Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205, 217 (1979);  SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393
U. S. 453, 458 (1969), the McCarran-Ferguson Act was precipitated by our

HARTFORD FIRE INS. CO. v. CALIFORNIA
SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment
3269, and H. R. 3270 before the Subcommittees of the Senate
Committee  on  the  Judiciary,  78th  Cong.,  :Lst  Sess.,  pt. 2,
p. 335  (1943)  (statement of Edward L. Williams,  President,
Insurance  Executives  Association)  ("[T]he  companies  that
want  to  come into  the Interstate  Underwriters  Board can
come in there.  I do not know of any company that is turned
down").  Thus, presumably, the refusals to deal orchestrated
by the defendants would cease if the targets agreed to join the
association  and abide by its terms.  See post, at 801  ("The
refusal to deal may...  be conditional" (emphasis omitted)).
Third,  contrary  to petitioners'  contentions,  see  Brief for
Petitioners  in No. 91-1111,  pp. 32,  n. 14,  34, 38-39, a §3(b)
boycott need not entail unequal treatment of the targets of
the boycott and its instigators.  Some refusals to deal (those,
perhaps, which are alleged to violate only § 2 of the Sherman
Act 15)  may have as their object the complete destruction of
the business of competitors;  these may well involve uncon-
ditional  discrimination  against the targets.  Other refusals
to deal, however, may seek simply to prevent competition as
to the price or features of the product  sold; and these need
not depend on unequal treatment of the targets.  Assuming,
holding in South-Eastern Underwriterst hat the business of insurance was
interstate  commerce  and  thus  subject  generally  to  federal  regulation
under the Commerce Clause, and to scrutiny under the Sherman Act spe-
cifically.  Congress responded, both to "ensure that the States would con-
tinue to have the ability to tax and regulate the business of insurance,"
Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S., at 217-218 (footnote omitted), and to limit the
application of the antitrust laws to the insurance industry, id., at 218.  In
drafting the § 3(b) exception to the § 2(b) grant of antilrust immunity, Con-
gress borrowed language from our description of the indictment in South-
Eastern Underwriters as charging that "[t]he  conspirators not only fixed
premium rates and agents' commissions, but employed boycotts together
with other types of coercion  and intimidation to force nonmember insur-
ance companies into the conspiracies."  322 U. S., at 535.
15S ection 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 2,
prohibits  monopolization  of, or attempts  or conspiracies  to monopolize,
"any part of the trade or commerce  among the several States, or with
foreign nations."

SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment
as the South-Eastern Underwriters Court appears to have
done, that membership in the defendant association was open
to all insurers, the association is most readily seen as having
intended to treat all insurers equally: they all had the choice
either to join the association and abide by its rules, or to be
subjected to the "boycotts," and acts of coercion and intimi-
dation,  alleged  in  that  case.  See post, at  808  (describing
South-Eastern Underwriters as  involving  a  "boycott,  by
primary insurers,  of competitors who refused  to join their
price-fixing conspiracy").
Fourth, although a necessary element, "concerted activity"
is not, by itself, sufficient for a  finding  of "boycott"  under
§ 3(b).  Were  this the case,  we recognized  in Barry, § 3(b)
might well "'devour  the broad antitrust immunity bestowed
by § 2(b),"' 438 U. S., at 545, n. 18 (quoting id., at 559 (Stew-
art, J., dissenting)), since every "contract, combination in the
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade
or commerce,"  15 U. S. C. § 1, involves  "concerted activity."
Thus,  we  suggested,  simple  price  fixing  has  been  treated
neither as a boycott nor as coercion  "int he absence  of any
additional enforcement activity."  438 U. S., at 545, n. 18; see
post, at 804 (contending that simple concerted agreements on
contract terms  are not properly characterized  as boycotts).
Contrary  to the  majority's  view, however,  our  decisions
have suggested that "enforcement activity" is a multifarious
concept.  The  South-Eastern Underwriters Court,  which
coined the phrase "boycotts[,]...  coercion and intimidation,"
322  U. S.,  at 535;  see  n.  14,  supra, provides  us  with  a list
of actions  that, it finds, are  encompassed  by  these  terms.
"Companies  not  members  of  [the  association],"  it  states,
"were  cut off from the opportunity to reinsure their risks,
and  their  services  and  facilities  were  disparaged;  inde-
pendent  sales  agencies  who  defiantly  represented  non-
[association]  companies  were  punished  by a  withdrawal  of
the  right  to  represent  the  members  of  [the  association];
and  persons  needing  insurance  who  purchased  from  non-
