STEVENS, J., dissenting
simply rely on AT&T's bald assertion, supported only by a
statement of the Magistrate taken  out of context, that the
tort  claim  is  "wholly  derivative";  we  have  an  obligation
either to study the record  or at least to remand  and  allow
the lower  courts to consider  the proper application  of the
legal rule to the facts of this case.
I respectfully dissent.
