Opinion of the Court
makes the league  more  like a single bargaining employer,
which analogy seems irrelevant to the legal issue before us.
We  also concede  that football players  often have special
individual talents, and, unlike many unionized workers, they
often negotiate their pay individually with their employers.
See post, at 255 (STEVENS, J.,  dissenting).  But this charac-
teristic seems  simply  a feature,  like so  many others,  that
might give employees (or employers) more (or less) bargain-
ing power, that might lead some (or all) of them to favor a
particular kind of bargaining, or that might lead to certain
demands  at the  bargaining  table.  We  do  not  see  how  it
could make a critical legal difference in determining the un-
derlying framework in  which  bargaining  is  to take  place.
See generally Jacobs & Winter, Antitrust Principles and Col-
lective Bargaining by Athletes: Of Superstars in Peonage, 81
Yale L. J. 1 (1971).  Indeed, it would be odd to fashion an"
antitrust exemption that gave additional advantages to pro-
fessional  football players  (by virtue of their  superior bar-
gaining power) that transport workers, coal miners, or meat
packers would not'enjoy.
The dissent points to other "unique features" of the par-
ties' collective-bargaining relationship, which, in the dissent's
view, make the case "atypical."  Post, at 255.  It says, for
example, that the employers  imposed the restraint  simply
to enforce compliance  with league-wide rules, and that the
bargaining consisted of nothing more than the sending of a
"notice," and therefore amounted only to "so-called" bargain-
ing.  Post, at 256-257.  Insofar  as these features underlie
an 'argument for looking to the employers' true purpose, we
have already discussed them.  See supra, at 247-248.  Inso-
far as they suggest that there was not a genuine impasse,
they  fight  the  basic  assumption  upon  which  the  District
Court, the Court of Appeals, petitioners, and this Court rest
the case.  See  782 F. Supp.  125,  134 (DC  1991);  50 F. 3d,
at 1056-1057; Pet. for Cert. i.  Ultimately, we cannot find a
satisfactory  basis  for  distinguishing  football  players  from

Opinion of the Court
other  organized  workers.  We  therefore  conclude  that all
must abide by the same legal rules.
For these reasons,  we hold that the implicit  ("nonstatu-
tory") antitrust exemption applies  to the employer conduct
at issue here.  That conduct took place during and immedi-
ately after a collective-bargaining negotiation.  It grew out
of, and was directly related to, the lawful  operation  of the
bargaining process.  It involved a matter  that the parties
were required  to negotiate  collectively.  And it concerned
only the parties to the collective-bargaining  relationship.
Our  holding  is  not  intended  to  insulate  from  antitrust
review every joint imposition of terms by employers, for an
agreement among employers  could be sufficiently distant in
time  and  in  circumstances  from  the  collective-bargaining
process that a rule permitting  antitrust intervention would
not significantly interfere with that process.  See, e. g., 50 F.
3d, at 1057 (suggesting that exemption lasts until collapse of
the collective-bargaining relationship, as evidenced by decer-
tification of the union); El Cerrito Mill & Lumber Co.,  316
N. L. R. B., at 1006-1007 (suggesting that "extremely long"
impasse,  accompanied  by  "instability"  or  "defunctness"  of
multiemployer  unit, might justify  union  withdrawal  from
group bargaining).  We need not decide in this case whether,
or where, within these extreme  outer boundaries  to draw
that line.  Nor would it be appropriate for us to do so with-
out the detailed views  of the Board, to whose  "specialized
judgment" Congress "intended to leave" many of the "inevi-
table questions concerning  multiemployer bargaining bound
to arise in the future."  Buffalo Linen, 353 U. S., at 96 (in-
ternal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  also  Jewel  Tea,  381
U. S., at 710, n. 18.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
