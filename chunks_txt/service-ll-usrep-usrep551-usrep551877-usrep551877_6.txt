Opinion of the Court 
be provided even absent free riding.  It may be difﬁcult and 
inefﬁcient for a manufacturer to make and enforce a contract 
with a retailer specifying the different services the retailer 
must perform.  Offering the retailer a guaranteed margin 
and threatening termination if it does not live up to expecta­
tions may be the most efﬁcient way to expand the manufac­
turer’s market share by inducing the retailer’s performance 
and allowing it to use its own initiative and experience in 
providing valuable services.  See Mathewson & Winter, The 
Law and Economics of Resale Price Maintenance, 13 Rev. 
Indus. Org. 57, 74–75 (1998) (hereinafter Mathewson & Win­
ter); Klein & Murphy, Vertical Restraints as Contract En­
forcement Mechanisms, 31 J. Law & Econ. 265, 295 (1988); 
see also Deneckere, Marvel, & Peck, Demand Uncertainty, 
Inventories, and Resale Price Maintenance, 111 Q. J. Econ. 
885, 911 (1996) (noting that resale price maintenance may be 
beneﬁcial to motivate retailers to stock adequate inventories 
of a manufacturer’s goods in the face of uncertain consumer 
demand). 
B 
While vertical agreements setting minimum resale prices 
can have procompetitive justiﬁcations, they may have anti­
competitive effects in other cases; and unlawful price ﬁxing, 
designed solely to obtain monopoly proﬁts, is an ever-present 
temptation.  Resale price maintenance may, for example, fa­
cilitate  a  manufacturer  cartel.  See  Business  Electronics, 
485 U. S., at 725.  An unlawful cartel will seek to discover 
if  some  manufacturers  are  undercutting  the  cartel’s  ﬁxed 
prices.  Resale price maintenance could assist the cartel in 
identifying price-cutting manufacturers who beneﬁt from the 
lower prices they offer.  Resale price maintenance, further­
more, could discourage a manufacturer from cutting prices 
to retailers with the concomitant beneﬁt of cheaper prices 
to consumers.  See ibid.; see also Posner 172; Overstreet 
19–23.

Opinion of the Court 
Vertical price restraints also “might be used to organize 
cartels at the retailer level.”  Business Electronics, supra, 
at 725–726.  A group of retailers might collude to ﬁx prices 
to consumers and then compel a manufacturer to aid the un­
lawful arrangement with resale price maintenance.  In that 
instance the manufacturer does not establish the practice to 
stimulate services or to promote its brand but to give inefﬁ­
cient retailers higher proﬁts.  Retailers with better distri­
bution  systems  and  lower  cost  structures  would  be  pre­
vented from charging lower prices by the agreement.  See 
Posner 172; Overstreet 13–19.  Historical examples suggest 
this possibility is a legitimate concern.  See, e. g., Marvel & 
McCafferty,  The  Welfare  Effects  of  Resale  Price  Mainte­
nance, 28 J. Law & Econ. 363, 373 (1985) (hereinafter Marvel) 
(providing an example of the power of the National Associa­
tion of Retail Druggists to compel manufacturers to use re­
sale price maintenance); Hovenkamp 186 (suggesting that the 
retail druggists in Dr. Miles formed a cartel and used manu­
facturers to enforce it). 
A  horizontal  cartel  among  competing  manufacturers  or 
competing retailers that decreases output or reduces compe­
tition in order to increase price is, and ought to be, per se 
unlawful.  See Texaco, 547 U. S., at 5; GTE Sylvania, 433 
U. S., at 58, n. 28.  To the extent a vertical agreement set­
ting  minimum  resale  prices  is  entered  upon  to  facilitate 
either type of cartel, it, too, would need to be held unlawful 
under the rule of reason.  This type of agreement may also 
be useful evidence for a plaintiff attempting to prove the 
existence of a horizontal cartel. 
Resale price maintenance, furthermore, can be abused by 
a powerful manufacturer or retailer.  A dominant retailer, 
for example, might request resale price maintenance to fore­
stall innovation in distribution that decreases costs.  A man­
ufacturer might consider it has little choice but to accommo­
date the retailer’s demands for vertical price restraints if 
the manufacturer believes it needs access to the retailer’s

distribution network.  See Overstreet 31; 8 P. Areeda & H. 
Hovenkamp,  Antitrust  Law  47  (2d  ed.  2004)  (hereinafter 
Areeda & Hovenkamp); cf. Toys “R” Us, Inc. v.  FTC, 221 
F. 3d 928, 937–938 (CA7 2000).  A manufacturer with market 
power, by comparison, might use resale price maintenance to 
give retailers an incentive not to sell the products of smaller 
rivals  or  new  entrants.  See,  e. g.,  Marvel  366–368.  As 
should be evident, the potential anticompetitive conse­
quences of vertical price restraints must not be ignored or 
underestimated. 
C 
Notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct, it cannot 
be stated with any degree of conﬁdence that resale price 
maintenance  “always  or  almost  always  tend[s]  to  restrict 
competition  and  decrease  output.”  Business  Electronics, 
supra, at 723 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Vertical 
agreements  establishing  minimum  resale  prices  can  have 
either procompetitive or anticompetitive effects, depending 
upon the circumstances in which they are formed.  And al­
though the empirical evidence on the topic is limited, it does 
not suggest efﬁcient uses of the agreements are infrequent 
or hypothetical.  See Overstreet 170; see also id., at 80 (not­
ing that for the majority of enforcement actions brought by 
the Federal Trade Commission between 1965 and 1982, “the 
use of [resale price maintenance] was not likely motivated by 
collusive dealers who had successfully coerced their suppli­
ers”); Ippolito 292 (reaching a similar conclusion).  As the 
rule  would  proscribe  a  signiﬁcant  amount  of  procompeti­
tive conduct, these agreements appear ill suited for per se 
condemnation. 
Respondent contends, nonetheless, that vertical price re­
straints should be per se unlawful because of the administra­
tive convenience of per se rules.  See, e. g., GTE Sylvania, 
supra, at 50, n. 16 (noting “per se rules tend to provide guid­
ance to the business community and to minimize the burdens 
on litigants and the judicial system”).  That argument sug­
