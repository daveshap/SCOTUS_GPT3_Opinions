to exit the market for purchasing inputs, it will seek to “re­
strict its input purchases below the competitive level,” thus 
“reduc[ing] the unit price for the remaining input[s] it pur­
chases.”  Salop, Anticompetitive Overbuying by Power 
Buyers, 72 Antitrust L. J. 669, 672 (2005) (hereinafter Salop). 
The reduction in input prices will lead to “a signiﬁcant cost 
saving that more than offsets the proﬁt[s] that would have 
been earned on the output.”  Ibid.  If all goes as planned, 
the predatory bidder will reap monopsonistic proﬁts that will 
offset any losses suffered in bidding up input prices.2  (In 
this case, the plaintiff was the defendant’s competitor in the 
input-purchasing market.  Thus, this case does not present 
a situation of suppliers suing a monopsonist buyer under § 2 
of the Sherman Act, nor does it present a risk of signiﬁcantly 
increased concentration in the market in which the monopso­
nist sells, i. e., the market for ﬁnished lumber.)

Predatory-pricing and predatory-bidding claims are ana­
lytically similar.  See Hovenkamp, The Law of Exclusionary 
Pricing, 2 Competition Policy Int’l, No. 1, pp. 21, 35 (Spring 
2006).  This similarity results from the close theoretical con­
nection between monopoly and monopsony.  See Kirkwood 
653 (describing monopsony as the “mirror image” of monop­
oly); Khan v. State Oil Co., 93 F. 3d 1358, 1361 (CA7 1996) 
(“[M]onopsony pricing . . . is a nalytically the same as monop­
oly or cartel pricing and [is] so treated by the law”), vacated 
and remanded on other grounds, 522 U. S. 3 (1997); Vogel v. 
2 If the predatory ﬁrm’s competitors in the input market and the output 
market are the same, then predatory bidding can also lead to the bidder’s 
acquisition of monopoly power in the output market.  In that case, which 
does not appear to be present here, the monopsonist could, under certain 
market conditions, also recoup its losses by raising output prices to monop­
olistic levels.  See Salop 679–682 (describing a monopsonist’s predatory 
strategy that depends upon raising prices in the output market).

322  WEYERHAEUSER CO. v. ROSS-SIMMONS HARDWOOD 
LUMBER CO. 
Opinion of the Court 
American Soc. of Appraisers, 744 F. 2d 598, 601 (CA7 1984) 
(“[M]onopoly and monopsony are symmetrical distortions of 
competition from an economic standpoint”); see also Hearing 
on Monopsony Issues in Agriculture: Buying Power of Proc­
essors in Our Nation’s Agricultural Markets before the Sen­
ate Committee on the Judiciary, 108th Cong., 1st Sess., 13 
(2004).  The kinship between monopoly and monopsony sug­
gests that similar legal standards should apply to claims of 
monopolization and to claims of monopsonization.  Cf. Noll, 
“Buyer Power” and Economic Policy, 72 Antitrust L. J. 589, 
591 (2005) (“[A]symmetric treatment of monopoly and mo­
nopsony has no basis in economic analysis”). 
Tracking the economic similarity between monopoly and 
monopsony, predatory-pricing plaintiffs and predatory­
bidding  plaintiffs  make  strikingly  similar  allegations.  A 
predatory-pricing plaintiff alleges that a predator cut prices 
to drive the plaintiff out of business and, thereby, to reap 
monopoly proﬁts from the output market.  In parallel fash­
ion,  a  predatory-bidding  plaintiff  alleges  that  a  predator 
raised prices for a key input to drive the plaintiff out of busi­
ness and, thereby, to reap monopsony proﬁts in the input 
market.  Both claims involve the deliberate use of unilateral 
pricing measures for anticompetitive purposes.3  And both 
claims logically require ﬁrms to incur short-term losses on 
the chance that they might reap supracompetitive proﬁts in 
the future. 
3 Predatory bidding on inputs is not analytically different from preda­
tory overbuying of inputs.  Both practices fall under the rubric of monop­
sony predation and involve an input purchaser’s use of input prices in an 
attempt to exclude rival input purchasers.  The economic effect of the 
practices is identical: Input prices rise.  In a predatory-bidding scheme, 
the purchaser causes prices to rise by offering to pay more for inputs.  In 
a predatory-overbuying scheme, the purchaser causes prices to rise by 
demanding more of the input.  Either way, input prices increase.  Our 
use of the term “predatory bidding” is not meant to suggest that different 
legal treatment is appropriate for the economically identical practice of 
“predatory overbuying.”

More  importantly,  predatory  bidding  mirrors  predatory 
pricing in respects that we deemed signiﬁcant to our analysis 
in Brooke Group.  In Brooke Group, we noted that “ ‘preda­
tory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely 
successful.’ ”  509  U. S.,  at  226  (quoting  Matsushita,  475 
U. S., at 589).  Predatory pricing requires a ﬁrm to suffer 
certain losses in the short term on the chance of reaping 
supracompetitive proﬁts in the future.  Id., at 588–589.  A 
rational business will rarely make this sacriﬁce.  Ibid.  The 
same reasoning applies to predatory bidding.  A predatory­
bidding scheme requires a buyer of inputs to suffer losses 
today on the chance that it will reap supracompetitive proﬁts 
in the future.  For this reason, “[s]uccessful monopsony pre­
dation is probably as unlikely as successful monopoly preda­
tion.”  R. Blair & J. Harrison, Monopsony 66 (1993). 
And like the predatory conduct alleged in Brooke Group, 
actions taken in a predatory-bidding scheme are often “‘“the 
very essence of competition.” ’ ”  509 U. S., at 226 (quoting 
Cargill, 479 U. S., at 122, n. 17, in turn quoting Matsushita, 
supra, at 594).  Just as sellers use output prices to compete 
for purchasers, buyers use bid prices to compete for scarce 
inputs.  There are myriad legitimate reasons—ranging from 
benign to afﬁrmatively procompetitive—why a buyer might 
bid up input prices.  A ﬁrm might bid up inputs as a result 
of miscalculation of its input needs or as a response to in­
creased consumer demand for its outputs.  A more efﬁcient 
ﬁrm might bid up input prices to acquire more inputs as a 
part of a procompetitive strategy to gain market share in the 
output market.  A ﬁrm that has adopted an input-intensive 
production process might bid up inputs to acquire the inputs 
necessary  for  its  process.  Or  a  ﬁrm  might  bid  up  input 
prices to acquire excess inputs as a hedge against the risk of 
future rises in input costs or future input shortages.  See 
Salop 682–683; Kirkwood 655.  There is nothing illicit about 
these bidding decisions.  Indeed, this sort of high bidding is
