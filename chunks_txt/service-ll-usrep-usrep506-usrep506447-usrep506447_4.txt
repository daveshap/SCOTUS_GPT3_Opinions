Opinion of the Court
be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal
patent claim in terms of the relevant market for the product
involved.  Ibid.  The reason was that "[w]ithout a definition
of that market there is no way to measure  [the defendant's]
ability to lessen or destroy competition."  Ibid.
Similarly, this Court reaffirmed in Copperweld Corp. v. In-
dependence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752 (1984),  that "Congress
authorized  Sherman Act scrutiny of single firms only when
they  pose  a  danger  of monopolization.  Judging unilateral
conduct  in this manner  reduces  the  risk that the antitrust
laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive
entrepreneur."  Id., at 768.  Thus, the conduct of a  single
firm,  governed  by  ยง 2,  "is  unlawful  only when it  threatens
actual monopolization."  Id., at 767.  See also Lorain Jour-
nal Co. v.  United States, 342  U. S.  143,  154  (1951);  United
States v. Griffith, 334  U. S.  100,  105-106  (1948);  American
Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S. 781, 785 (1946).
The Courts of Appeals other than the Ninth Circuit have
followed  this  approach.  Consistent  with  our  cases,  it  is
generally required that to demonstrate attempted monopoli-
zation  a  plaintiff  must  prove  (1)  that  the  defendant  has
engaged in predatory or anticompetitive  conduct  with (2) a
specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous  probability
of  achieving  monopoly  power.  See  3  Areeda  &  Turner,
supra,  820, at 312.  In order to determine  whether  there
is  a  dangerous  probability  of monopolization,  courts  have
found  it necessary  to consider the  relevant  market and the
defendant's  ability to  lessen or destroy  competition  in  that
8
market.

at 1431-1432;  Twin Laboratories,I nc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.
2d, at 570; Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of
America, 885 F. 2d, at 693; Indiana Grocery, Inc. v. Super Valu Stores,
Inc., 864 F. 2d, at 1413-1416; General Industries Corp. v. Hartz Mountain
Corp., 810 F. 2d, at 804.

Opinion of the Court
Notwithstanding the array of authority contrary to Lessig,
the Court of Appeals in this case reaffirmed  its prior hold-
ings; indeed, it did not mention either this Court's decisions
discussed  above  or the many  decisions  of other  Courts  of
Appeals reaching contrary results.  Respondents urge us to
affirm the decision  below.  We are not at all inclined,  how-
ever, to embrace  Lessig's interpretation  of ยง 2,  for there is
little, if any, support for it in the statute or the case law, and
the notion that proof of unfair or predatory conduct alone is
sufficient to make out the offense of attempted monopoliza-
tion is  contrary  to the purpose  and  policy of the Sherman
Act.
The Lessig opinion claimed  support from the language of
ยง 2,  which  prohibits  attempts  to  monopolize  "any  part" of
commerce, and therefore forbids attempts to monopolize any
appreciable  segment  of  interstate  sales  of  the  relevant
product.  See United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218,
226  (1947).  The  "any  part"  clause,  however,  applies  to
charges of monopolization as well as to attempts to monopo-
lize, and it is beyond doubt that the former requires proof of
market power in a relevant market.  United States v. Grin-
nell Corp., 384  U. S.  563,  570-571  (1966);  United States v.
E.  I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351  U. S. 377, 404 (1956).9
In support of its determination  that an inference  of dan-
gerous probability was permissible from a showing of intent,
the Lessig opinion cited, and added emphasis to, this Court's
reference  in  its opinion  in Swift to  "'intent  and  the conse-
quent dangerous probability."'  327 F. 2d, at 474, n. 46, quot-
ing 196 U. S., at 396.  But any question whether dangerous
9 Lessig cited  United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S., at 226, in sup-
port of its interpretation, but Yellow Cab relied on the "any part" language
to support the proposition that it is immaterial how large an amount of
interstate trade is affected, or how important that part of commerce is in
relation to the entire amount of that type of commerce in the Nation.

Opinion of the Court
probability  of success  requires  proof  of more  than  intent
alone should have been removed by the subsequent passage
in Swift which stated that "not every act that may be done
with intent to produce an unlawful result ...  constitutes an
attempt.  It is  a  question  of proximity  and  degree."  Id.,
at 402.
The Lessig court  also relied  on a footnote  in Du Pont &
Co.,  supra, at 395, n. 23, for the proposition that when the
charge is attempt to monopolize, the relevant market is "not
in issue."  That footnote, which  appeared in analysis  of the
relevant  market  issue  in  Du  Pont, rejected  the  Govern-
ment's reliance on several cases, noting that "the scope of the
market was not in issue" in Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson
Parchment Paper Co., 282 U. S. 555 (1931).  That reference
merely reflected  the  fact  that, in Story Parchment, which
was not an  attempt to monopolize case, the parties  did not
challenge the definition of the market adopted by the lower
courts.  Nor was Du Pont itself concerned with the issue in
this case.
It is also our view that Lessig and later Ninth Circuit deci-
sions refining and applying it are inconsistent with the policy
of the Sherman Act.  The purpose  of the Act is not to pro-
tect businesses from the working of the market; it is to pro-
tect the public from the failure of the market.  The law di-
rects  itself not against  conduct  which  is competitive,  even
severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to de-
stroy competition itself.  It does so not out of solicitude for
private concerns but out of concern for the public interest.
See, e. g., Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429
U. S.  477, 488 (1977);  Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado,
Inc., 479 U. S.  104, 116-117 (1986); Brown Shoe Co. v. United
States, 370 U. S. 294, 320 (1962).  Thus, this Court and other
courts have been careful to avoid  constructions  of ยง 2 which
might chill  competition,  rather  than foster it.  It is  some-
