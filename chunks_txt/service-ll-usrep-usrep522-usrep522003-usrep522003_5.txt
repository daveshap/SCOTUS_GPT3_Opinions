procompetitive  potential  of a  vertical  maximum  price  re-
straint is more evident..,  than it was when Albrecht was
decided,  because  exclusive  territorial  arrangements  and
other nonprice  restrictions were  unlawful per se in  1968."
495 U. S., at 343, n. 13 (citing several commentators identify-
ing procompetitive effects of vertical maximum price fixing,
including, e. g.,  P. Areeda  & H. Hovenkamp,  Antitrust Law
340.30b, p. 378, n. 24  (1988  Supp.); Blair & Harrison, Re-
thinking Antitrust Injury, 42 Vand. L. Rev. 1539, 1553 (1989);

Thus, our reconsideration of Albrecht's continuing validity
is informed by several of our decisions, as well as a consider-
able body of scholarship discussing the effects of vertical re-
straints.  Our  analysis  is also guided by our general  view
that the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect
interbrand  competition.  See,  e. g.,  Business  Electronics
Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U. S. 717, 726 (1988).
"Low prices," we have explained, "benefit consumers regard-
less of how those prices are set, and so long as they are above
predatory levels, they do not threaten competition."  ARCO,
supra, at 340.  Our interpretation of the Sherman Act also
incorporates  the notion that  condemnation  of practices  re-
sulting in lower  prices  to consumers  is  "especially  costly"
because "cutting prices in order to increase business often is
the very essence of competition."  Matsushita Elec. Indus-
trial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S.5 74, 594 (1986).
So informed, we find it difficult to maintain that vertically
imposed maximum prices could harm consumers or competi-
tion to the extent necessary to justify their per se invalida-
tion.  As Chief Judge Posner wrote for the Court of Appeals
in this case:
"As for maximum resale price fixing, unless the supplier
is a monopsonist he cannot squeeze his dealers' margins

Opinion of the Court
below  a  competitive level; the attempt to do so would
just drive the dealers into the arms of a competing sup-
plier.  A supplier might, however, fix a maximum resale
price in order to prevent his dealers from exploiting a
monopoly position....  [Sluppose that State Oil, perhaps
to encourage...  dealer services...  has spaced its deal-
ers  sufficiently  far  apart  to  limit  competition  among
them (or even given each of them an exclusive territory);
and suppose further that Union 76 is a sufficiently dis-
tinctive and popular brand to give the dealers in it at
least  a modicum  of monopoly  power.  Then  State  Oil
might  want  to  place  a  ceiling  on  the  dealers'  resale
prices in order to prevent them from exploiting that mo-
nopoly power fully.  It would do this not out of disinter-
ested malice, but in its  commercial  self-interest.  The
higher the price at which gasoline is resold, the smaller
the volume sold, and so the lower the profit to the sup-
plier if the higher profit per gallon at the higher price is
being snared by the dealer."  93 F. 3d, at 1362.
See  also  R.  Bork,  The  Antitrust  Paradox  281-282  (1978)
("There could, of course, be no anticonsumer effect from [the
type of price fixing considered in Albrech], and one suspects
that the paper has a legitimate interest in keeping subscriber
prices down  in order to increase  circulation  and  maximize
revenues from advertising").
We recognize that the Albrecht decision presented a num-
ber of theoretical justifications for a per se rule against verti-
cal maximum price fixing.  But criticism of those premises
abounds.  The  Albrecht decision  was grounded  in the fear
that maximum price fixing by suppliers could interfere with
dealer freedom.  390 U. S., at 152.  In response, as one com-
mentator has pointed out, "the ban on maximum resale price
limitations declared in Albrecht in the name of 'dealer free-
dom'  has  actually  prompted  many  suppliers  to  integrate
forward into  distribution,  thus  eliminating the  very  inde-
pendent  trader  for  whom  Albrecht professed  solicitude."

8 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law  1635, p. 395 (1989)  (hereinafter
Areeda).  For example, integration in the newspaper indus-
try since Albrecht has given rise to litigation between inde-
pendent distributors  and publishers.  See P. Areeda  & H.
Hovenkamp, supra,  729.7, pp. 599-614 (1996 Supp.).
The Albrecht Court also expressed the concern that maxi-
mum prices may be set too low for dealers to offer consumers
essential  or  desired  services.  390  U. S.,  at  152-153.  But
such conduct, by driving away customers, would seem likely
to harm  manufacturers  as  well as  dealers  and  consumers,
making it unlikely that a supplier would set such a price as
a matter of business judgment.  See, e. g., Lopatka, Stephen
Breyer and Modern Antitrust: A Snug Fit, 40 Antitrust Bull.
1, 60  (1995);  Blair  & Lang, Albrecht After  ARCO:  Maxi-
mum Resale Price Fixing Moves  Toward the Rule of Rea-
son, 44 Vand. L. Rev. 1007, 1034 (1991).  In addition, Albrecht
noted  that vertical maximum  price  fixing could  effectively
channel  distribution through large  or specially advantaged
dealers.  390 U. S.,  at 153.  It is unclear, however, that a
supplier  would profit from  limiting its market by  exclud-
ing potential dealers.  See, e. g., Easterbrook 905-908.  Fur-
ther, although vertical maximum price fixing might limit the
viability of inefficient dealers, that consequence is not neces-
sarily harmful to competition and consumers.  See, e. g., id.,
at 907; Lopatka, supra, at 60.
Finally, Albrecht reflected the Court's fear that maximum
price fixing could  be used to disguise  arrangements  to fix
minimum prices, 390 U. S.,  at 153, which remain illegal per
se.  Although  we  have  acknowledged  the  possibility  that
maximum pricing'might mask minimum pricing,  see Mari-
copa County, 457  U. S.,  at 348, we believe  that such  con-
duct-as with the other concerns  articulated in Albrecht--
can be appropriately recognized and punished under the rule
of reason.  See, e. g., Easterbrook 901-904; see also Pitofsky,
