Opinion of the Court
accordance with this intent, namely, as limiting an antitrust
court's authority to determine, in the area of industrial con-
flict, what is or is not a "reasonable"  practice.  It thereby
substitutes  legislative  and administrative  labor-related  de-
terminations for judicial antitrust-related  determinations as
to  the  appropriate  legAl  limits  of industrial  conflict.  See
Jewel Tea, supra, at 709-710.
As a matter of logic, it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to require groups of employers and employees to bargain to-
gether, but at the same time to forbid them to make among
themselves  or  with  each  other  any  of  the  competition-
restricting  agreements  potentially  necessary  to make  the
process work or its results mutually acceptable.  Thus, the
implicit exemption recognizes that, to give effect to federal
labor laws  and  policies  and  to  allow meaningful  collective
bargaining to take place, some restraints on"c ompetition im-
posed through the bargaining process must be shielded from
antitrust  sanctions.  See  Connell, supra, at  622  (federal
labor laws "goals" could "never" be achieved if ordinary anti-
competitive effects of collective bargaining were held to vio-
late the antitrust laws); Jewel Tea, sUpra, at 711  (national
labor law scheme would be "virtually destroyed" by the rou-
tine imposition  of antitrust penalties upon parties engaged
in collective bargaining); Pennington, supra, at 665 (implicit
exemption  necessary to harmonize  Sherman Act with "na-
tional policy  ...  of promoting 'the  peaceful  settlement  of
industrial disputes by subjecting labor-management contro-
versies to the mediatory influence  of negotiation'")  (quoting
Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB,  379 U.S. 203,
211 (1964)).
The  petitioners  and  their  supporters  concede,  as  they
must, the  legal  existence  of  the  exemption  we  have  de-
scribed.  They  also  concede  that, where  its application  is
necessary  to  make  the  statutorily  authorized  collective-
bargaining process work as Congress  intended, the exemp-
tion  must  apply  both  to  employers  and  to  employees.

v. Actors' Equity Assn., 451 U. S. 704, 717, n. 20 (1981)  (ex-
plicit "statutory" exemption applies only to "bona fide labor
organization[s]").  Nor  does  the  dissent  take  issue  with
these basic principles.  See post, at 253-254.  Consequently,
the question before us is one of determining the exemption's
scope: Does it apply to an agreement among several employ-
ers  bargaining  together  to  implement  after  impasse  the
terms of their last best good-faith wage offer?  We assume
that such  conduct, as practiced in this  case, is unobjection-
able as a matter of labor law and policy.  On that assump-
tion, we conclude that the exemption applies.
Labor law itself regulates  directly, and  considerably, the
kind of behavior here at issue-the postimpasse imposition
of a proposed employment term concerning a mandatory sub-
ject of bargaining.  Both the Board and the courts have held
that, after impasse, labor law permits employers unilaterally
to  implement  changes  in pre-existing  conditions,  but only
insofar as the new terms meet carefully circumscribed con-
ditions.  For example, the new terms must be "reasonably
comprehended" within the employer's preimpasse  proposals
(typically the last rejected proposals), lest by imposing more
or less favorable  terms, the employer unfairly undermined
the union's status.  Storer Communications, Inc., 294

any unfair labor practice,  such  as an  employer's  failure to
have bargained in good faith.  See Akron Novelty Mfg. Co.,
224  N. L. R. B.  998, 1002  (1976)  (where employer  has  not
bargained in good faith, it may not implement a term of em-
ployment);  1 P. Hardin, The Developing Labor Law 697 (3d

passe and an accompanying implementation of proposals con-
stitute an integral part of the bargaining process.  See Bo-

Although the case law we have cited focuses upon bargain-
ing by a single employer, no one here has argued that labor
law does, or should, treat multiemployer  bargaining differ-
ently  in  this  respect.  Indeed,  Board  and  court  decisions
suggest  that the joint  implementation  of proposed  terms
after impasse is a familiar practice in the context of multiem-
ployer bargaining.  See, e. g., El Cerrito Mill & Lumber Co.,
