Opinion of the Court 
the defendant was selling its unpatented salt at competitive 
prices, id., at 396–397, the rule adopted in International 
Salt necessarily accepted the Government’s submission that 
the earlier patent misuse cases supported the broader propo­
sition “that this type of restraint is unlawful on its face under 
the Sherman Act,” United States Brief 12. 
Indeed, later in the same Term we cited International 
Salt for the proposition that the license of “a patented device 
on condition that unpatented materials be employed in con­
junction with the patented device” is an example of a re­
straint that is “illegal per se.”  United States v. Columbia 
Steel Co., 334 U. S. 495, 522–523, and n. 22 (1948).  And in 
subsequent cases we have repeatedly grounded the presump­
tion of market power over a patented device in Interna­
tional Salt.  See, e. g., Loew’s, 371 U. S., at 45–46; Times-
Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U. S. 594, 608 
(1953); Standard Oil Co., 337 U. S., at 304. 
IV 
Although the patent misuse doctrine and our antitrust ju­
risprudence became intertwined in International Salt, sub­
sequent events initiated their untwining.  This process has 
ultimately led to today’s reexamination of the presumption of 
per se illegality of a tying arrangement involving a patented 
product, the ﬁrst case since 1947 in which we have granted 
review to consider the presumption’s continuing validity. 
Three years before we decided International Salt, this 
Court had expanded the scope of the patent misuse doctrine 
to include not only supplies or materials used by a patented 
device, but also tying arrangements involving a combination 
patent and “unpatented material or [a] device [that] is itself 
an  integral  part  of  the  structure  embodying  the  patent.” 
Mercoid, 320 U. S., at 665; see also Dawson Chemical Co. v. 
Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 188–198 (1980) (describing 
in detail Mercoid and the cases leading up to it).  In reach­
ing this conclusion, the Court explained that it could see “no

difference in principle” between cases involving elements es­
sential to the inventive character of the patent and elements 
peripheral to it; both, in the Court’s view, were attempts 
to “expan[d] the patent beyond the legitimate scope of its 
monopoly.”  Mercoid, 320 U. S., at 665. 
Shortly thereafter, Congress codiﬁed the patent laws for 
the ﬁrst time.  See 66 Stat. 792, codiﬁed at 35 U. S. C. § 1 
et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. III).  At least partly in response 
to our Mercoid decision, Congress included a provision in 
its codiﬁcation that excluded some conduct, such as a tying 
arrangement involving the sale of a patented product tied to 
an “essential” or “nonstaple” product that has no use except 
as part of the patented product or method, from the scope of 
the patent misuse doctrine.  § 271(d); see also Dawson, 448 
U. S., at 214.  Thus, at the same time that our antitrust ju­
risprudence continued to rely on the assumption that “tying 
arrangements generally serve no legitimate business pur­
pose,” Fortner I, 394 U. S., at 503, Congress began chipping 
away at the assumption in the patent misuse context from 
whence it came. 
It is Congress’ most recent narrowing of the patent misuse 
defense, however, that is directly relevant to this case.  Four 
years after our decision in Jefferson Parish repeated the 
patent-equals-market-power  presumption,  466 U. S.,  at  16, 
Congress amended the Patent Code to eliminate that pre­
sumption in the patent misuse context, 102 Stat. 4676.  The 
relevant provision reads: 
“(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for 
infringement or contributory infringement of a patent 
shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or ille­
gal extension of the patent right by reason of his having 
done one or more of the following: . . . (5) conditioned 
the license of any rights to the patent or the sale of the 
patented product on the acquisition of a license to rights 
in another patent or purchase of a separate product, un­
less, in view of the circumstances, the patent owner has

Opinion of the Court 
market power in the relevant market for the patent or 
patented product on which the license or sale is condi­
tioned.”  35 U. S. C. § 271(d)(5) (emphasis added). 
The italicized clause makes it clear that Congress did not 
intend the mere existence of a patent to constitute the requi­
site “market power.”  Indeed, fairly read, it provides that 
without proof that Trident had market power in the relevant 
market, its conduct at issue in this case was neither “misuse” 
nor an “illegal extension of the patent right.” 
While the 1988 amendment does not expressly refer to the 
antitrust laws, it certainly invites a reappraisal of the per se 
rule announced in International Salt.3  A rule denying a 
patentee the right to enjoin an infringer is signiﬁcantly less 
severe than a rule that makes the conduct at issue a federal 
crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison.  See 15 U. S. C. 
§ 1.  It would be absurd to assume that Congress intended 
to provide that the use of a patent that merited punishment 
as a felony would not constitute “misuse.”  Moreover, given 
the fact that the patent misuse doctrine provided the basis 
for the market power presumption, it would be anomalous 
to  preserve  the  presumption  in  antitrust  after  Congress 
has  eliminated its foundation.  Cf.  10 P. Areeda, H. 
Hovenkamp, & E. Elhauge, Antitrust Law ¶ 1737c (2d ed. 
2004) (hereinafter Areeda). 
After considering the congressional judgment reﬂected in 
the 1988 amendment, we conclude that tying arrangements 
involving patented products should be evaluated under the 
standards applied in cases like Fortner II and Jefferson Par­
ish rather than under the per se rule applied in Morton Salt 
and Loew’s.  While some such arrangements are still unlaw­
3 While our opinions have made clear that such an invitation is not neces­
sary with respect to cases arising under the Sherman Act, see State Oil 
Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997), it is certainly sufﬁcient to warrant 
reevaluation of our precedent, id., at 21 (“[T]his Court has reconsidered 
its decisions construing the Sherman Act when the theoretical underpin­
nings of those decisions are called into serious question”).
