I can ﬁnd no change in circumstances in the past several 
decades that helps the majority’s position.  In fact, there has 
been one important change that argues strongly to the con­
trary.  In 1975, Congress repealed the McGuire and Miller-
Tydings Acts.  See Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975, 89 
Stat. 801.  And it thereby consciously extended Dr. Miles’ 
per se rule.  Indeed, at that time the Department of Justice 
and the FTC, then urging application of the per se rule, dis­
cussed  virtually  every  argument  presented  now  to  this 
Court as well as others not here presented.  And they ex­
plained to Congress why Congress should reject them.  See 
Hearings  on  S.  408,  at  176–177  (statement  of  Thomas  E. 
Kauper, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division); id., 
at 170–172 (testimony of Lewis A. Engman, Chairman of the 
FTC); Hearings on H. R. 2384, at 113–114 (testimony of Keith 
I. Clearwaters, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Anti­
trust  Division).  Congress  fully  understood,  and  conse­
quently intended, that the result of its repeal of McGuire 
and Miller-Tydings would be to make minimum resale price 
maintenance per se unlawful.  See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 94–466, 
pp. 1–3 (1975) (“Without [the exemptions authorized by the 
Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts,] the agreements they au­
thorize would violate the antitrust laws. . . . [R]epeal of the 
fair trade laws generally will prohibit manufacturers from 
enforcing resale prices”).  See also Sylvania, supra, at 51, 
n. 18 (“Congress recently has expressed its approval of a per 
se analysis of vertical price restrictions by repealing those 
provisions of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts allowing 
fair-trade pricing at the option of the individual States”). 
Congress did not prohibit this Court from reconsidering 
the per se rule.  But enacting major legislation premised 
upon the existence of that rule constitutes important public

reliance upon that rule.  And doing so aware of the relevant 
arguments  constitutes  even  stronger  reliance  upon  the 
Court’s keeping the rule, at least in the absence of some sig­
niﬁcant change in respect to those arguments. 
Have there been any such changes?  There have been a 
few economic studies, described in some of the briefs, that 
argue, contrary to the testimony of the Justice Department 
and the FTC to Congress in 1975, that resale price mainte­
nance is not harmful.  One study, relying on an analysis of 
litigated resale price maintenance cases from 1975 to 1982, 
concludes that resale price maintenance does not ordinarily 
involve producer or dealer collusion.  See Ippolito, Resale 
Price Maintenance: Empirical Evidence from Litigation, 34 
J. Law & Econ. 263, 281–282, 292 (1991).  But this study 
equates the failure of plaintiffs to allege collusion with the 
absence of collusion—an equation that overlooks the super­
ﬂuous nature of allegations of horizontal collusion in a resale 
price maintenance case and the tacit form that such collusion 
might take.  See H. Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy 
§ 11.3c, p. 464, n. 19 (3d ed. 2005); supra, at 911. 
The other study provides a theoretical basis for concluding 
that resale price maintenance “need not lead to higher retail 
prices.”  Marvel  &  McCafferty,  The  Political  Economy  of 
Resale Price Maintenance, 94 J. Pol. Econ. 1074, 1075 (1986). 
But  this  study  develops  a  theoretical  model  “under  the 
assumption  that  [resale  price  maintenance]  is  efﬁciency­
enhancing.”  Ibid.  Its  only  empirical  support  is  a  1940 
study that the authors acknowledge is much criticized.  See 
id., at 1091.  And many other economists take a different 
view.  See Brief for  William S. Comanor et  al. as Amici 
Curiae 4. 
Regardless,  taken  together,  these  studies  at  most  may 
offer  some  mild  support  for  the  majority’s  position.  But 
they cannot constitute a major change in circumstances. 
Petitioner and some amici have also presented us with 
newer studies that show that resale price maintenance some­

times  brings  consumer  beneﬁts.  Overstreet  119–129  (de­
scribing numerous case studies).  But the proponents of a 
per se rule have always conceded as much.  What is remark­
able about the majority’s arguments is that nothing in this 
respect is new.  See supra, at 910, 919 (citing articles and 
congressional testimony going back several decades).  The 
only new feature of these arguments lies in the fact that the 
most current advocates of overruling Dr. Miles have aban­
doned a host of other not-very-persuasive arguments upon 
which  prior  resale  price  maintenance  proponents  used  to 
rely.  See, e. g., 8 Areeda ¶ 1631a, at 350–352 (listing “ ‘[t]ra­
ditional’ justiﬁcations” for resale price maintenance). 
The one arguable exception consists of the majority’s claim 
that  “even  absent  free  riding,”  resale  price  maintenance 
“may be the most efﬁcient way to expand the manufacturer’s 
market  share  by  inducing  the  retailer’s  performance  and 
allowing it to use its own initiative and experience in provid­
ing valuable services.”  Ante, at 892.  I cannot count this 
as an exception, however, because I do not understand how, 
in the absence of free riding (and assuming competitiveness), 
an  established  producer  would  need  resale  price  mainte­
nance.  Why, on these assumptions, would a dealer not “ex­
pand” its “market share” as best that dealer sees ﬁt, obtain­
ing  appropriate  payment  from  consumers  in  the  process? 
There may be an answer to this question.  But I have not 
seen it.  And I do not think that we should place signiﬁcant 
weight upon  justiﬁcations that  the parties do  not explain 
with sufﬁcient clarity for a generalist judge to understand. 
No one claims that the American economy has changed 
in ways that might support the majority.  Concentration in 
retailing has increased.  See, e. g., Brief for Respondent 18 
(since minimum resale price maintenance was banned nation­
wide in 1975, the total number of retailers has dropped while 
the growth in sales per store has risen); Brief for American 
Antitrust Institute as Amicus Curiae 17, n. 20 (citing private 
study reporting that the combined sales of the 10 largest
