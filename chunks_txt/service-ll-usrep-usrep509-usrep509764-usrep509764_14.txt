Opinion of the Court
this  expansion  of the refusal  to deal  beyond  the targeted
transaction that gives great coercive force to a  commercial
boycott:  unrelated  transactions  are  used  as  leverage  to
achieve the terms desired.
The  proper  definition  of  "boycott"  is  evident  from  the
Court's  opinion in  Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers'
Assn. v. United States, 234 U. S. 600 (1914),  which is recog-
nized in the antitrust field as one of the "leading  case[s] in-
volving  commercial  boycotts."  Barber,  Refusals  to  Deal
under the Federal Antitrust Laws,  103 U. Pa. L.  Rev. 847,
873 (1955).  The associations of retail lumber dealers in that
case refused  to buy lumber  from wholesale  lumber  dealers
who sold directly to consumers.  The boycott attempted "to
impose as a condition ...  on  [the wholesale  dealers'] trade
that they shall not sell in such manner that a local retailer
may regard  such  sale  as  an  infringement  of his  exclusive
right to trade."  234  U. S.,  at 611.  We held  that to be  an
"'artificial  conditio[n],"'  since  "the trade  of the wholesaler
with strangers was directly affected, not because of any sup-
posed wrong which he had done to them, but because of the
grievance  of a member  of one  of the associations."  Id., at
611-612.  In  other words,  the associations'  activities  were
a boycott because  they sought an objective-the  wholesale
dealers' forbearance from retail trade-that was collateral to
their transactions with the wholesalers.
Of course as far as the Sherman Act (outside the exempted
insurance  field) is concerned,  concerted  agreements on  con-
tract  terms  are  as unlawful  as  boycotts.  For  example, in
Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U. S.
30 (1930),  and United States v. First Nat. Pictures, Inc., 282
U. S. 44 (1930),  we held  unreasonable  an agreement among
competing motion picture distributors under which  they re-
fused  to license  films to exhibitors  except on  standardized
terms.  We also found unreasonable the restraint of trade in
Anderson v. Shipowners Assn. of Pacific Coast, 272  U. S.
359  (1926),  which  involved  an attempt  by an association  of

Opinion of the Court
employers to establish industry-wide  terms of employment.
These  sorts of concerted  actions, similar to what is alleged
to  have  occurred  here,  are  not  properly  characterized  as
"boycotts,"  and  the word does  not appear  in the opinions.'
In fact, in the 65 years between the coining of the word and
enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945, "boycott"
appears in only seven opinions of this Court involving com-
mercial (nonlabor) antitrust matters, and not once is it used
as JUSTICE SOUTER uses it-to describe a concerted refusal
to engage in particular transactions until the terms of those
transactions are agreeable.4
In addition to its use in the antitrust field, the concept of
"boycott" frequently appears in labor law, and in this context
as  well  there  is  a  clear  distinction  between  boycotts  and
concerted  agreements  seeking terms.  The! ordinary strike
8JUSnCE SOUTER points out that the Court in St. Paul Fire & Marine
Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U. S. 531 (1978), found the term "boycott" "does not
refer to "'a unitary phenomenon,"'"  ante, at 788 (quoting Barry, supra,
at 543 (quoting P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 381 (2d ed.  1974))), and as-
serts that our position contradicts this.  Ante, at 793.-794.  But to be not
a "unitary phenomenon" is different from being an all-encompassing  one.
"Boycott" is a multifaceted  "phenomenon" that includes conditional boy-
cotts, punitive boycotts, coercive boycotts, partial boycotts, labor boycotts,
political boycotts, social boycotts, etc.  It merely does not include refusals
to deal because of objections to proposed terms.

Opinion of the Court
seeking better  contract  terms  is a "refusal  to deal"-i. e.,
union members  refuse to sell their labor until the employer
capitulates  to  their  contract  demands.  But no  one  would
call this a boycott, because  the conditions  of the "refusal to
deal" relate directly to the terms of the refused transaction
(the employment contract).  A refusal to work changes from
strike to boycott only when it seeks to obtain action from
the employer  unrelated to  the employment  contract.  This
distinction is well illustrated by the famous boycott of Pull-
man cars by Eugene Debs' American Railway Union in 1894.
The incident began when workers at the Pullman Palace Car
Company called  a  strike, but  the "boycott"  occurred  only
when  other members  of the American  Railway  Union, not
Pullman  employees,  supported  the strikers  by refusing  to
work on any train drawing a Pullman car.  See In re Debs,
158  U. S.  564,  566-567  (1895)  (statement of  the  case);  H.
Laidler,  Boycotts  and  the  Labor  Struggle  100-108 (1968).
The  refusal to handle Pullman cars had  nothing to do with
Pullman cars  themselves (working on Pullman  cars was  no
more  difficult  or  dangerous  than  working  on  other  cars);
rather, it was  in  furtherance  of the collateral  objective  of
obtaining better employment terms for the Pullman workers.
In other labor cases  as well, the term "boycott" invariably
holds the meaning that we ascribe to it: Its goal is to alter,
not the terms of the refused  transaction, but the terms of
workers' employment.5
6See, e. g., Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Stone Cutters, 274 U. S. 37, 47, 49
(1927) (refusal to work on stone received from nonunion quarries); Duplex
Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S.4 43, 462-463 (1921)  (boycott of
target's product until it agreed to union's employment demands); Gompers
v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221  U. S. 418 (1911)  (boycott of company's
products because of allegedly unfair labor practices); Loewe v. Lawlor, 208
U. S.2 74 (1908)  (boycott of fur hats made by a company  that would not
allow its workers to be unionized).  See also Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader,
310  U. S. 469,  503-505  (1940)  (distinguishing between  ordinary  strikes
and boycotts).
