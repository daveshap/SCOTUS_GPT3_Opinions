Opinion of the Court
the registration,  use,  and  infringement  of trademarks  and
related marks, § 43(a),  15 U. S. C.  § 1125(a) is one of the few
provisions that goes beyond trademark protection.  As orig-
inally  enacted,  § 43(a)  created  a  federal  remedy  against  a
person who used in commerce either "a false designation of
origin, or any false description or representation" in connec-
tion with  "any  goods  or services."  60  Stat. 441.  As  the
Second Circuit accurately observed with regard to the origi-
nal enactment, however-and as remains true after the 1988
revision-§ 43(a)  "does  not have  boundless  application  as  a
remedy  for unfair trade practices,"  Alfred Dunhill, Ltd. v.
Interstate Cigar Co., 499  F. 2d 232, 237  (1974).  "[B]ecause
of its inherently limited wording, § 43(a) can never be a fed-
eral 'codification'  of the overall law of 'unfair competition,"'
4  J. McCarthy, Trademarks  and  Unfair Competition  §27:7,
p. 27-14 (4th ed.  2002)  (McCarthy),  but  can  apply  only  to
certain unfair trade practices prohibited by its text.
Although  a  case  can be  made  that a  proper  reading  of
§43(a),  as originally enacted, would treat the word "origin"
as referring  only  "to the geographic  location  in which  the
goods  originated,"  Two  Pesos, Inc. v.  Taco  Cabana, Inc.,
505  U. S.7 63, 777  (1992)  (STEVENS,  J.,  concurring in judg-
ment),3 the Courts of Appeals considering  the issue, begin-
3In the original provision, the cause of action for false designation of
origin was arguably "available only to a person doing business in the local-
ity falsely indicated as that of origin," 505 U. S., at 778, n. 3.  As adopted
in 1946, §43(a) provided in full:
"Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with
any goods  or services, or any container  or containers for goods, a false
designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including
words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same,
and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, and any
person who shall with knowledge of the falsity of such designation of ori-
gin or description or representation cause or procure the same to be trans-
ported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be trans-
ported or used, shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business
in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or the region in which
said locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is

FILM CORP.
Opinion of the Court
ning  with  the  Sixth  Circuit,  unanimously  concluded  that
it  "does not  merely  refer  to geographical  origin,  but also
to origin of source  or manufacture,"  Federal-Mogul-Bower
Bearings, Inc. v. Azoff, 313  F. 2d  405, 408  (1963),  thereby
creating a federal  cause of action for  traditional trademark
infringement of unregistered  marks.  See 4 McCarthy
§ 27:14;  Two  Pesos, supra, at 768.  Moreover, every  Circuit
to  consider the  issue found  § 43(a) broad  enough to encom-
pass  reverse  passing off.  See,  e.g.,  Williams v.  Curtiss-
Wright Corp., 691  F. 2d 168,  172 (CA3 1982); Arrow United
Indus., Inc. v. Hugh Richards, Inc., 678 F. 2d 410, 415 (CA2
1982); F. E. L. Publications,L td. v. Catholic Bishop of Chi-
cago, 214 USPQ 409, 416 (CA7 1982); Smith v. Montoro, 648
F. 2d 602, 603 (CA9 1981); Bangor Punta Operations,I nc. v.
UniversalM  arine Co., 543 F. 2d 1107, 1109 (CA5 1976).  The
Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 made clear that § 43(a)
covers  origin  of production  as  well  as  geographic  origin.4
Its language is amply inclusive, moreover, of reverse passing
off-if  indeed  it does  not  implicitly  adopt  the  unanimous
court-of-appeals  jurisprudence  on  that subject.  See,  e. g.,
likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or represen-
tation."  60 Stat. 441.
4 Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act now provides:
"Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any
container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or
device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false
or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation  of
fact, which-

the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another per-
son, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, serv-
ices, or commercial activities by another person, or
"(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature,
characteristics,  qualities, or geographic  origin of his or her or another
person's goods, services, or commercial activities,
"shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she

Opinion of the Court
Alpo  Petfoods, Inc. v.  Ralston Purina Co.,  913  F. 2d  958,
963-964, n. 6 (CADC 1990) (Thomas, J.).
Thus, as it comes to us, the gravamen of respondents' claim
is that, in marketing and selling Campaigns as its own prod-
uct without  acknowledging its nearly wholesale  reliance  on
the Crusade television series, Dastar has made a "false des-
ignation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or
false or misleading representation  of fact, which ...i s likely
to cause confusion...  as to the origin... of his or her goods."
§ 43(a).  See, e. g.,  Brief for Respondents  8, 11.  That claim
would undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had bought some
of New  Line's  Crusade videotapes  and  merely  repackaged
them as its own.  Dastar's alleged wrongdoing, however, is
vastly  different:  It  took a  creative  work  in the  public do-
main-the Crusade television series-copied  it, made modi-
fications (arguably minor), and produced its very own series
of videotapes.  If "origin" refers  only to the manufacturer
or producer of the physical "goods"  that are made available
to the  public (in this case the videotapes), Dastar  was  the
origin.  If, however, "origin'! includes the creator of the un-
derlying work that Dastar copied,  then someone else  (per-
haps  Fox) was the origin of Dastar's product.  At bottom,
we must decide what § 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act means
by the "origin" of "goods."
III
The dictionary definition of "origin" is "[tihe  fact or proc-
ess of coming  into being  from a  source,"  and  "[t]hat  from
which  anything  primarily  proceeds;  source."  Webster's
New International Dictionary 1720-1721 (2d ed. 1949).  And
the  dictionary  definition  of  "goods"  (as  relevant  here)  is
"[w]ares;  merchandise."  Id., at  1079.  We  think the most
natural understanding of the "origin" of "goods"-the source
of wares-is the producer of the tangible product sold in the
marketplace, in this case the physical Campaigns videotape
sold by Dastar.  The concept might be stretched (as it was
