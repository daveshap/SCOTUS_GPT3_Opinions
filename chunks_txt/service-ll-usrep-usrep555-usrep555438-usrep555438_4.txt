Opinion of the Court 
reliance on the sort of price-squeeze theory accepted by the 
Court of Appeals.  At one point, for example, the plaintiffs 
suggest that “the DSL transport price” may be pertinent to 
their claims going forward under the theory of Judge Gould’s 
dissent; that opinion, however, concluded that Trinko “in es­
sence takes the issu[e] of wholesale pricing out of the case.” 
503 F. 3d, at 886.  Given this ambiguity, the case before us 
remains a live dispute appropriate for decision.  Cf. Friends 
of Earth, Inc. v.  Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), 
Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 189 (2000) (a party’s voluntary conduct 
renders a case moot only if it is “ ‘absolutely clear’ ” the party 
will take that course of action). 
Amici also argue that we should dismiss the writ of certio­
rari because of the “lack of adversarial presentation” by an 
interested party.  Brief for COMPTEL 7.  To the contrary, 
prudential concerns favor our answering the question pre­
sented.  Plaintiffs defended the Court of Appeals’ decision 
at the certiorari stage, and the parties have invested a sub­
stantial amount of time, effort, and resources in brieﬁng and 
arguing the merits of this case.  In the absence of a decision 
from this Court on the merits, the Court of Appeals’ decision 
would presumably remain binding precedent in the Ninth 
Circuit, and the Circuit conﬂict we granted certiorari to re­
solve would persist.  Two amici have submitted briefs de­
fending the Court of Appeals’ decision on the merits, and we 
granted the motion of one of those amici to participate in 
oral argument.  555 U. S. 1029 (2008).  We think it appro­
priate to proceed to address the question presented.

nations.”  Ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U. S. C. § 2.  Simply pos­

Opinion of the Court
 
sessing monopoly power and charging monopoly prices does 
not violate §2; rather, the statute targets “the willful acqui­
sition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from 
growth or development as a consequence of a superior prod­
uct, business acumen, or historic accident.”  United States 
v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S. 563, 570–571 (1966). 
As a general rule, businesses are free to choose the parties 
with whom they will deal, as well as the prices, terms, and 
conditions of that dealing.  See United States v. Colgate & 
Co., 250 U. S. 300, 307 (1919).  But there are rare instances 
in which a dominant ﬁrm may incur antitrust liability for 
purely unilateral conduct.  For example, we have ruled that 
ﬁrms may not charge “predatory” prices—below-cost prices 
that drive rivals out of the market and allow the monopolist 
to raise its prices later and recoup its losses.  Brooke Group, 
509 U. S., at 222–224.  Here, however, the complaint at issue 
does  not  contain  allegations  meeting  those  requirements. 
App. 10–24. 
There are also limited circumstances in which a ﬁrm’s uni­
lateral refusal to deal with its rivals can give rise to antitrust 
liability.  See Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing 
Corp.,  472  U. S.  585,  608–611  (1985).  Here,  however,  the 
District Court held that AT&T had no such antitrust duty to 
deal with its competitors, App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a–85a, and 
this holding was not challenged on appeal.2 
2 The Court of Appeals assumed that any duty to deal arose only from 
FCC regulations, 503 F. 3d 876, 878–879, n. 6 (CA9 2007), and the question 
on which we granted certiorari made the same assumption.  Even aside 
from the District Court’s reasoning, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a–85a, it 
seems quite unlikely that AT&T would have an antitrust duty to deal with 
the plaintiffs.  Such a duty requires a showing of monopoly power, but— 
as the FCC has recognized, In re Appropriate Framework for Broadband 
Access to Internet Over Wireline Facilities, 20 FCC Rcd. 14853, 14879– 
14887 (2005)—the market for high-speed Internet service is now quite 
competitive; DSL providers face stiff competition from cable companies 
and wireless and satellite providers.

Opinion of the Court 
The challenge here focuses on retail prices—where there 
is no predatory pricing—and the terms of dealing—where 
there  is  no  duty  to  deal.  Plaintiffs’  price-squeeze  claims 
challenge a different type of unilateral conduct in which a 
ﬁrm “squeezes” the proﬁt margins of its competitors.  This 
requires the defendant to be operating in two markets, a 
wholesale (“upstream”) market and a retail (“downstream”) 
market.  A ﬁrm with market power in the upstream mar­
ket can squeeze its downstream competitors by raising the 
wholesale price of inputs while cutting its own retail prices. 
This will raise competitors’ costs (because they will have to 
pay more for their inputs) and lower their revenues (because 
they will have to match the dominant ﬁrm’s low retail price). 
Price-squeeze plaintiffs assert that defendants must leave 
them a “fair” or “adequate” margin between the wholesale 
price and the retail price.  In this case, we consider whether 
a plaintiff can state a price-squeeze claim when the defend­
ant has no obligation under the antitrust laws to deal with 
the plaintiff at wholesale.

1. A straightforward application of our recent decision in 
Trinko forecloses any challenge to AT&T’s wholesale prices. 
In Trinko, Verizon was required by statute to lease its net­
work elements to competing ﬁrms at wholesale rates.  540 
U. S., at 402–403.  The plaintiff—a customer of one of Veri­
zon’s rivals—asserted that Verizon denied its competitors ac­
cess to interconnection support services, making it difﬁcult 
for those competitors to ﬁll their customers’ orders.  Id., at 
404–405.  The complaint alleged that this conduct in the up­
stream market violated § 2 of the Sherman Act by impeding 
the ability of independent carriers to compete in the down­
stream market for local telephone service.  Ibid. 
We  held  that  the  plaintiff’s  claims  were  not  actionable 
under § 2.  Given that Verizon had no antitrust duty to deal 
with its rivals at all, we concluded that “Verizon’s alleged
