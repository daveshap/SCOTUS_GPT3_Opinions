Breyer, J., dissenting 
Fifth, the fact that a case involves property rights or con­
tract rights, where reliance interests are involved, argues 
against  overruling.  Payne,  supra,  at  828.  This  case  in­
volves contract rights and perhaps property rights (consider 
shopping malls).  And there has been considerable reliance 
upon the per se rule.  As I have said, Congress relied upon 
the continued vitality of Dr. Miles when it repealed Miller-
Tydings and McGuire.  Supra, at 919–920.  The Executive 
Branch argued for repeal on the assumption that Dr. Miles 
stated the law.  Supra, at 919–920.  Moreover, whole sec­
tors of the economy have come to rely upon the per se rule. 
A factory outlet store tells us that the rule “form[s] an essen­
tial part of the regulatory background against which [that 
ﬁrm] and many other discount retailers have ﬁnanced, struc­
tured, and operated their businesses.”  Brief for Burlington 
Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. as Amicus Curiae 5.  The 
Consumer  Federation  of  America  tells  us  that  large  low­
price retailers would not exist without Dr. Miles; minimum 
resale  price  maintenance,  “by  stabilizing  price  levels  and 
preventing low-price competition, erects a potentially insur­
mountable barrier to entry for such low-price innovators.” 
Brief for Consumer Federation of America as Amicus Cu­
riae 5, 7–9 (discussing, inter alia, comments by Wal-Mart’s 
founder 25 years ago that relaxation of the per se ban on 
minimum resale price maintenance would be a “ ‘great dan­
ger’ ” to Wal-Mart’s then-relatively-nascent business).  See 
also Brief for American Antitrust Institute as Amicus Cu­
riae  14–15,  and  sources  cited  therein  (making  the  same 
point).  New  distributors,  including  internet  distributors, 
have similarly invested time, money, and labor in an effort 
to bring yet lower cost goods to Americans. 
This Court’s overruling of the per se rule jeopardizes this 
reliance, and more.  What about malls built on the assump­
tion that a discount distributor will remain an anchor tenant? 
What about home buyers who have taken a home’s distance

from such a mall into account?  What about Americans, pro­
ducers, distributors, and consumers, who have understand­
ably assumed, at least for the last 30 years, that price compe­
tition  is  a  legally  guaranteed  way  of  life?  The  majority 
denies  none  of  this.  It  simply  says  that  these  “reliance 
interests . . . , like the reliance interests in [State Oil Co. v.] 
Khan, [522 U. S. 3 (1997),] cannot justify an inefﬁcient rule.” 
Ante, at 906. 
The Court minimizes the importance of this reliance, add­
ing that it “is also of note” that at the time resale price main­
tenance contracts were lawful “ ‘no more than a tiny fraction 
of  manufacturers  ever  employed’ ”  the  practice.  Ante,  at 
907  (quoting  Overstreet  6).  By  “tiny”  the  Court  means 
manufacturers that accounted for up to “ ‘ten percent of con­
sumer  goods  purchases’ ”  annually.  Ante,  at  907.  That 
ﬁgure in today’s economy equals just over $300 billion.  See 
Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract 
of the United States: 2007, p. 649 (126th ed.) (over $3 trillion 
in U. S. retail sales in 2002).  Putting the Court’s estimate 
together with the Justice Department’s early 1970’s study 
translates a legal regime that permits all resale price main­
tenance into retail bills that are higher by an average of 
roughly $750 to $1,000 annually for an American family of 
four.  Just how much higher retail bills will be after the 
Court’s decision today, of course, depends upon what is now 
unknown, namely, how courts will decide future cases under 
a  “rule  of  reason.”  But  these  ﬁgures  indicate  that  the 
amounts involved are important to American families and 
cannot be dismissed as “tiny.” 
Sixth, the fact that a rule of law has become “embedded” 
in our “national culture” argues strongly against overruling. 
Dickerson v.  United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443–444 (2000). 
The per se  rule forbidding minimum resale  price mainte­
nance agreements has long been “embedded” in the law of 
antitrust.  It involves price, the economy’s “ ‘central nervous 
system.’ ”  National  Soc.  of  Professional  Engineers,  435

Breyer, J., dissenting 
U. S., at 692 (quoting Socony-Vacuum Oil, 310 U. S., at 226, 
n. 59).  It reﬂects a basic antitrust assumption (that consum­
ers often prefer lower prices to more service).  It embod­
ies a basic antitrust objective (providing consumers with a 
free choice about such matters).  And it creates an easily 
administered  and  enforceable  bright  line,  “Do  not  agree 
about price,” that businesses as well as lawyers have long 
understood. 
The only contrary stare decisis factor that the majority 
mentions consists of its claim that this Court has “[f]rom the 
beginning . . .  treated the Sherman Act as a common-law 
statute,” and has previously overruled antitrust precedent. 
Ante, at 899, 900–902.  It points in support to State Oil Co. 
v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3 (1997), overruling Albrecht v. Herald Co., 
390 U. S. 145 (1968), in which this Court had held that maxi­
mum resale price agreements were unlawful per se, and to 
Sylvania, overruling United States v.  Arnold, Schwinn & 
Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967), in which this Court had held that 
producer-imposed territorial limits were unlawful per se. 
The  Court  decided  Khan,  however,  29  years  after  Al­
brecht—still a signiﬁcant period, but nowhere close to the 
century Dr. Miles has stood.  The Court speciﬁcally noted 
the lack of any signiﬁcant reliance upon Albrecht.  522 U. S., 
at 18–19 (Albrecht has had “little or no relevance to ongoing 
enforcement of the Sherman Act”).  Albrecht had far less 
support in traditional antitrust principles than did Dr. Miles. 
Compare, e. g., 8 Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 1632, at 316–328 
(analyzing potential harms of minimum resale price mainte­
nance),  with  id.,  ¶ 1637,  at  352–361  (analyzing  potential 
harms  of  maximum  resale  price  maintenance).  See  also, 
e. g., Pitofsky 1490, n. 17.  And Congress had nowhere ex­
pressed support for Albrecht’s rule.  Khan, supra, at 19. 
In Sylvania, the Court, in overruling Schwinn, explicitly 
distinguished Dr. Miles on the ground that while Congress 
had “recently . . . expressed its approval of a per se analy­
sis of vertical price restrictions” by repealing the Miller­
