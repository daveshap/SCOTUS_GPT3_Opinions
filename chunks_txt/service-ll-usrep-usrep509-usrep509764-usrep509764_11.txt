Opinion of the Court
enon,"' Barry, 438 U. S., at 543, to which the term "boycott"
will henceforth be confined, is of course at odds with our own
description of our Sherman Act cases in Barry.19  See ibid.
Moreover,  the  limitation  to  "collateral"  refusals  to  deal
threatens  to shrink  the § 3(b) exception  far more  than the
majority is willing to admit.  Even if the reinsurers refused
all reinsurance to primary insurers "who wrote insurance on
disfavored forms,"  including insurance  "as to risks written
on other forms,"  the majority  states, the  reinsurers  would
not be engaging in a § 3(b) boycott if "the primary insurers'
other business were relevant to the proposed insurance con-
tract (for example, if the reinsurer bears greater risk where
the primary insurer engages  in riskier businesses)."  Post,
at 810 (emphasis deleted).  Under this standard, and under
facts  comparable  to  those in  this  litigation,  I assume  that
reinsurers  who refuse to deal at all with a primary insurer
unless it ceases insuring a particular risk would not be en-
gaging in a § 3(b) boycott if they could show that (1) insuring
the risk in question increases  the probabiLity  that the pri-
mary insurer will become insolvent, and that (2) it costs more
to administer the reinsurance  contracts of' a bankrupt  pri-
mary  insurer  (including  those  unrelated  to  the  risk  that
caused  the primary insurer to declare  bankruptcy).  One
can only imagine the variety of similar arguments that may
slowly plug what remains of the § 3(b) exception.  For these
reasons, I cannot agree with the majority's narrow theory of
§ 3(b) boycotts.

Finally, we take up the question presented by No. 91-1128,
whether certain claims against the London reinsurers should
have been dismissed  as improper applications  of the Sher-

because it can be modified by such adjectives as "punitive," "labor," "politi-
cal," and "social."  Post, at 804, n. 3.  This does not hide the fact that it
is attempting to concoct  a "precise definition" of the term, post, at 800,
composed of a simple set of necessary and sufficient conditions.

man Act to foreign conduct.  The  Fifth Claim for Relief in
the  California  Complaint  alleges  a  violation  of  § 1 of the
Sherman Act by certain London reinsurers who conspired to
coerce primary insurers in the  United States to offer CGL
coverage  on  a  claims-made  basis,  thereby  making  "occur-
rence CGL coverage..,  unavailable in the State of California
for  many  risks."  App.  43-44  (  131-135).  The  Sixth
Claim for Relief in the California Complaint alleges that the
London reinsurers violated § 1 by a conspiracy to limit cover-
age of pollution risks in North America, thereby rendering
"pollution liability  coverage ...  almost entirely unavailable
for  the  vast majority  of casualty  insurance  purchasers  in
the State  of California."  Id.,  at 45-46  (  136-140).  The
Eighth Claim for Relief in the California Complaint alleges
a further § 1 violation by the London  reinsurers  who, along
with  domestic retrocessional  reinsurers,  conspired  to limit
coverage  of seepage, pollution,  and property contamination
risks in  North America, thereby eliminating such coverage
in the State of California.20  Id., at 47-48 ( 1 146-150).
At the outset, we note that the District Court undoubtedly
had jurisdiction of these Sherman Act claims, as the London
reinsurers  apparently  concede.  See  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  37
("Our position is not that the Sherman Act does not apply in
the sense that a minimal basis for the exercise of jurisdiction
doesn't  exist here.  Our  position  is  that there  are certain
circumstances,  and that this is one of them, in which the in-
terests of another  State are  sufficient  that the  exercise  of
that  jurisdiction  should  be  restrained").21  Although  the
2o As we have noted, see supra, at 776-777, each of these claims has a
counterpart in the Connecticut Complaint.  The claims each name differ-
ent groups of London reinsurers, and not all of the named defendants are
petitioners  in No. 91-1128;  but nothing in  our analysis  turns  on these
variations.
21O  ne of the London reinsurers, Sturge Reinsurance Syndicate Manage-
ment Limited, argues that the Sherman Act does not apply to its conduct
in attending a single meeting at which it allegedly agreed to exclude all
pollution coverage  from its reinsurance  contracts.  Brief for Petitioner

American Banana Co. v.  United Fruit Co.,  213  U. S.  347
(1909),  it is well established by now that the Sherman Act
applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did
in fact produce some substantial effect in the United States.

surance  in the United  States and that their conduct  in fact
produced substantial effect.21  See 938 F. 2d, at 933.

Sturge may have attended only one meeting, but the allegations, which
we are bound  to credit, remain that it participated  in conduct that was
intended to and did in fact produce a substantial effect on the American
insurance market.
2JUSTICE SCALIA believes that what is at issue in this litigation is pre-
scriptive,  as opposed  to subject-matter,  jurisdiction.  Post, at 813-814.
The parties  do  not question prescriptive  jurisdiction, however, and for
good reason: it is well established that Congress has exercised such juris-
diction under the Sherman Act.  See G. Born & D. Westin, International
Civil Litigation in United States Courts 542, n. 5 (2d ed. 1992) (Sherman
Act is a "prime exampl[e] of the simultaneous exercise of prescriptive ju-
risdiction and grant of subject matter jurisdiction").
21 Under  § 402 of the Foreign  Trade  Antitrust  Improvements  Act of
1982 (FTAIA), 96 Stat. 1246, 15 U. S. C. § 6a, the Sherman Act does not
apply to conduct involving foreign trade or commerce,  other than import
trade or import commerce, unless "such conduct has a direct, substantial,
and  reasonably  foreseeable  effect"  on  domestic  or'  import  commerce.
