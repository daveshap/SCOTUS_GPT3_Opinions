416  NATIONAL  RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION  v.
BOSTON & MAINE CORP.
Opinion of the Court
Appeals' decision  in this case, added  the following sentence
to  § 562(d)(1):  "The  Corporation  may  subsequently  convey
title or other interest in  such property to  a third  party, if
such  reconveyance  is found  by  the Commission  to further
the purposes of this Act."  Independent  Safety  Board  Act
Amendments of 1990  § 9(a), Pub. L.  101-641,  104 Stat. 4658.
The  amendment  was  made applicable  to all pending cases,
§ 9(b), and B&M does not dispute that it applied in this case
even while it was before the Court of Appeals on rehearing.
Brief for  Respondent  B&M  33-35.  The  Court of Appeals
considered the 1990 amendment, but denied rehearing none-
theless.  288 U. S. App. D. C. 196, 925 F. 2d 427 (1991).  The
panel majority held that while § 9 made it clear Amtrak was
authorized  to reconvey  condemned  property "subsequent to
a condemnation  that is  otherwise  valid under [§ 562(d)],"  it
did not change the statutory limitation that the property be
"'required  for intercity rail passenger service'  in the first
place.  Id., at 197, 925 F. 2d, at 428 (emphasis in  original).
The  majority reasoned  that since  its original decision  was
based  on Amtrak's  failure  to satisfy  that requirement,  the
amendment did not affect its holding.  The majority also dis-
tinguished  a case from the Second  Circuit, National Rail-
road PassengerC  orp. v. Two Parcels of Land, 822 F. 2d 1261,
cert.  denied,  484  U. S.  954  (1987),  which  had  interpreted
§ 545(d)(1)  (the provision  authorizing  Amtrak  to  condemn
nonrail property) to permit reconveyance  following condem-
nation.  288 U. S. App. D. C., at 196-197, 425 F. 2d, at 427-
428.  In a separate opinion, Judge Ginsburg wrote that the
amendment confirmed her view that the ICC had not misin-
terpreted the statute, but that a remand remained necessary
for further factual determinations.
Amtrak and CV, in No. 90-1419,  and the ICC, in No. 90-
1769, filed separate petitions seeking review of the Court of
Appeals'  decision.  We granted  certiorari and  consolidated
the cases.  502 U. S. 807 (1991).  We now reverse.

Opinion of the Court
II
The primary question raised by these cases  is a straight-
forward matter of statutory interpretation: whether § 562(d),
as  amended,  authorizes  the condemnation  and  transaction
approved by the ICC but set aside by the Court of Appeals.
The Court of Appeals disallowed the transaction based on its
own  interpretation  of the language  "required  for intercity
rail passenger service"  in § 562(d)(1).  In  so holding it lim-
ited Amtrak's condemnation authority to property that was
necessary, in the sense of indispensable, to Amtrak's opera-
tions.  The ICC interpreted the relevant statutory language
to give Amtrak more latitude, and it is our task to determine
whether  the  Commission  had  authority  for  its  statutory
interpretation.
Judicial  deference  to  reasonable  interpretations  by  an
agency  of a  statute that it administers  is a dominant, well-
settled principle of federal law.  We relied upon it in Chev-
ron U S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837 (1984), and have reaffirmed it often.  See, e. g.,
K mart Corp. v. Cartier,I nc., 486 U. S. 281, 292-293  (1988);
Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501  U. S.  680, 696-697
(1991).  These  decisions  mandate  that when  a court  is re-
viewing an agency decision based on a statutory interpreta-
tion, "if the statute  is silent or ambiguous  with respect to
the specific  issue, the question for the court is whether the
agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the
statute."  Chevron U S. A., supra,a t 843.  If the agency in-
terpretation is not in conflict with the plain language  of the
statute, deference  is due.  K mart Corp., 486  U. S., at 292.
In ascertaining whether the agency's interpretation is a per-
missible construction  of the language, a court must look to
the structure  and language  of the statute as a whole.  Id.,
at 291; Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83, 89 (1990).  If the
text is ambiguous  and so open to interpretation in some re-
spects, a degree of deference is granted to the agency, though

418  NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION  v.
BOSTON & MAINE CORP.
Opinion of the Court
a reviewing  court  need not accept an interpretation which
is unreasonable.
Under these principles the ICC's interpretation of § 562(d)
was permissible, and the Court of Appeals'  decision  was in
error to disregard it.  While the ICC's opinion is not explicit
in all  of its  details, the Commission's  decision  is based  on
a  reading of the statute  quite  different  from the Court of
Appeals'.  The  ICC agreed  that property Amtrak seeks  to
condemn under § 562(d) must be  "required for intercity rail
passenger service."  It determined, however, that the word
"required" need not mean, as the Court of Appeals'  opinion
suggests, indispensable or necessary.  Instead, the ICC gave
effect to the statutory presumption of Amtrak's need for the
track, and in so doing implemented and interpreted the stat-
ute in a manner that comports with its words and structure.
The analysis of the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with the
Commission's interpretation of the statutory presumption of
need.  The  ICC's  position  before  the  Court  is  that  "re-
quired" can also mean "useful or appropriate," Brief for Peti-
tioners in No. 90-1769, p. 17, and that the order under review
adopted that meaning.  We agree that the manner in which
the ICC has applied the statute in this case has that inter-
pretation as its basic premise.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.
90-1419, pp. 42a-46a.
In its brief the ICC cites a dictionary definition in support
of its view.  Brief for Petitioners in No. 90-1769, p. 17, citing
Webster's Third  New International  Dictionary  1929  (1986).
The  existence  of  alternative  dictionary  definitions  of  the
word "required," each making some sense under the statute,
itself indicates  that  the  statute  is  open  to interpretation.
See Sullivan v. Everhart, supra.  Few phrases in a complex
scheme  of regulation are so clear as to be beyond the need
for interpretation when applied in a real context.  Further,
the structure of the provision reinforces our conclusion that
statutory interpretation is appropriate and that the Court of
Appeals'  interpretation  is  itself open  to  serious  question.
