would make minimum resale price maintenance always (or 
almost always) unlawful?  Should they apply a “rule of rea­
son”?  Were the Court writing on a blank slate, I would ﬁnd 
these questions difﬁcult.  But, of course, the Court is not 
writing on a blank slate, and that fact makes a considerable 
legal difference. 
To best explain why the question would be difﬁcult were 
we deciding it afresh, I brieﬂy summarize several classical 
arguments for and against the use of a per se rule.  The 
arguments focus on three sets of considerations, those in­
volving:  (1)  potential  anticompetitive  effects,  (2)  potential 
beneﬁts, and (3) administration.  The difﬁculty arises out of 
the fact that the different sets of considerations point in dif­
ferent  directions.  See,  e. g.,  8  P.  Areeda,  Antitrust  Law

On  the  one  hand,  agreements  setting  minimum  resale 
prices may have serious anticompetitive consequences.  In 
respect  to  dealers:  Resale  price  maintenance  agreements, 
rather  like  horizontal  price  agreements,  can  diminish  or 
eliminate price competition among dealers of a single brand 
or (if practiced generally by manufacturers) among multi­
brand dealers.  In doing so, they can prevent dealers from 
offering  customers  the  lower  prices  that  many  customers 
prefer; they can prevent dealers from responding to changes

in demand, say, falling demand, by cutting prices; they can 
encourage dealers to substitute service, for price, competi­
tion, thereby threatening wastefully to attract too many re­
sources into that portion of the industry; they can inhibit 
expansion  by  more  efﬁcient  dealers  whose  lower  prices 
might otherwise attract more customers, stiﬂing the devel­
opment  of  new,  more  efﬁcient  modes  of  retailing;  and  so 
forth.  See, e. g., 8 Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 1632c, at 319– 
321; Steiner, The Evolution and Applications of Dual-Stage 
Thinking,  49  The  Antitrust  Bulletin  877,  899–900  (2004);

tions, and the New Antitrust Policy, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 983, 
990–1000 (1985). 
In respect to producers: Resale price maintenance agree­
ments can help to reinforce the competition-inhibiting behav­
ior of ﬁrms in concentrated industries.  In such industries 
ﬁrms may tacitly collude, i. e., observe each other’s pricing 
behavior, each understanding that price cutting by one ﬁrm 
is likely to trigger price competition by all.  See 8 Areeda & 
Hovenkamp  ¶ 1632d,  at  321–323;  P.  Areeda  &  L.  Kaplow, 
Antitrust  Analysis  ¶¶ 231–233,  pp.  276–283  (4th  ed.  1988) 
(hereinafter Areeda & Kaplow).  Cf. United States v. Con­
tainer  Corp.  of  America,  393  U. S.  333  (1969);  Areeda  & 
Kaplow  ¶¶ 247–253,  at  327–348.  Where  that  is  so,  resale 
price maintenance can make it easier for each producer to 
identify (by observing retail markets) when a competitor has 
begun to cut prices.  And a producer who cuts wholesale 
prices without lowering the minimum resale price will stand 
to gain little, if anything, in increased proﬁts, because the 
dealer will be unable to stimulate increased consumer de­
mand by passing along the producer’s price cut to consumers. 
In  either  case,  resale  price  maintenance  agreements  will 
tend to prevent price competition from “breaking out”; and 
they  will  thereby  tend  to  stabilize  producer  prices.  See 
Pitofsky  1490–1491.  Cf.,  e. g.,  Container  Corp.,  supra,  at 
336–337.

912  LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v. 
PSKS, INC. 
Breyer, J., dissenting 
Those who express concern about the potential anticom­
petitive  effects  ﬁnd  empirical  support  in  the  behavior  of 
prices before, and then after, Congress in 1975 repealed the 
Miller-Tydings Fair Trade Act, 50 Stat. 693, and the McGuire 
Act, 66 Stat. 631.  Those Acts had permitted (but not re­
quired) individual States to enact “fair trade” laws author­
izing  minimum  resale  price  maintenance.  At  the  time  of 
repeal minimum resale price maintenance was lawful in 36 
States; it was unlawful in 14 States.  See Hearings on S. 408 
before the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly of the 
Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 173 
(1975) (hereinafter Hearings on S. 408) (statement of Thomas 
E. Kauper, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division). 
Comparing prices in the former States with prices in the 
latter States, the Department of Justice argued that mini­
mum resale price maintenance had raised prices by 19% to 
27%.  See Hearings on H. R. 2384 before the Subcommittee 
on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the House Committee 
on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 122 (1975) (hereinafter 
Hearings on H. R. 2384) (statement of Keith I. Clearwaters, 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division). 
After repeal, minimum resale  price maintenance agree­
ments were unlawful per se in every State.  The Federal 
Trade  Commission  (FTC)  staff,  after  studying  numerous 
price  surveys,  wrote  that  collectively  the  surveys  “indi­
cate[d]  that  [resale  price  maintenance]  in  most  cases  in­
creased the prices of products sold with [resale price mainte­
nance].”  Bureau  of  Economics  Staff  Report  to  the  FTC, 
T. Overstreet, Resale Price Maintenance: Economic Theories 
and Empirical Evidence 160 (1983) (hereinafter Overstreet). 
Most economists today agree that, in the words of a promi­
nent antitrust treatise, “resale price maintenance tends to 
produce higher consumer prices than would otherwise be the 
case.”  8 Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 1604b, at 40 (ﬁnding “[t]he
