SIMCO GMC, INC. 
Opinion of the Court 
ingly receives the beneﬁt of such discrimination, or with 
customers of either of them . . . .”   15 U.S .C . §1 3(a).  
Pursuant to § 4 of the Clayton Act, a private plaintiff may 
recover threefold for actual injury sustained as a result of 
a  violation  of  the  Robinson-Patman  Act.  See  15  U. S. C. 
§ 15(a); J. Truett Payne Co. v.  Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 
U. S. 557, 562 (1981). 
Mindful of the purposes of the Act and of the antitrust 
laws  generally,  we  have  explained  that  Robinson-Patman 
does not “ban all price differences charged to different pur­
chasers of commodities of like grade and quality,” Brooke 
Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 
209, 220 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); rather, 
the Act proscribes “price discrimination only to the extent 
that it threatens to injure competition,” ibid.  Our decisions 
describe  three  categories  of  competitive  injury  that  may 
give rise to a Robinson-Patman Act claim: primary line, sec­
ondary line, and tertiary line.  Primary-line cases entail con­
duct—most  conspicuously,  predatory  pricing—that  injures 
competition at the level of the discriminating seller and its 
direct competitors.  See, e. g., id., at 220–222; see also Ho­
venkamp ¶ 2301a, pp. 4–6.  Secondary-line cases, of which 
this is one, involve price discrimination that injures competi­
tion among the discriminating seller’s customers (here, Vol­
vo’s dealerships); cases in this category typically refer to “fa­
vored” and “disfavored” purchasers.  See ibid.; Texaco Inc. 
v. Hasbrouck, 496 U. S. 543, 558, n. 15 (1990).  Tertiary-line 
cases involve injury to competition at the level of the pur­
chaser’s customers.  See Areeda ¶ 601e, p. 907. 
To  establish  the  secondary-line  injury of  which  it  com­
plains, Reeder had to show that (1) the relevant Volvo truck 
sales were made in interstate commerce; (2) the trucks were 
of “like grade and quality”; (3) Volvo “discriminate[d] in price 
between” Reeder and another purchaser of Volvo trucks; and 
(4) “the effect of such discrimination may be . . . to injure, 
destroy, or prevent competition” to the advantage of a fa­

Opinion of the Court 
vored purchaser, i. e., one who “receive[d] the beneﬁt of such 
discrimination.”  15 U. S. C. § 13(a).  It is undisputed that 
Reeder  has  satisﬁed  the  ﬁrst  and  second  requirements. 
Volvo and the United States, as amicus curiae, maintain that 
Reeder cannot satisfy the third and fourth requirements, be­
cause  Reeder  has  not  identiﬁed  any  differentially  priced 
transaction in which it was both a “purchaser” under the Act 
and “in actual competition” with a favored purchaser for the 
same customer. 
A hallmark of the requisite competitive injury, our deci­
sions indicate, is the diversion of sales or proﬁts from a disfa­
vored purchaser to a favored purchaser.  FTC v.  Sun Oil 
Co., 371 U. S. 505, 518–519 (1963) (evidence showed patronage 
shifted from disfavored dealers to favored dealers); Falls 
City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U. S. 428, 
437–438, and n. 8 (1983) (complaint “supported by direct evi­
dence of diverted sales”).  We have also recognized that a 
permissible inference of competitive injury may arise from 
evidence  that  a  favored  competitor  received  a  signiﬁcant 
price reduction over a substantial period of time.  See FTC 
v.  Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S. 37, 49–51 (1948); Falls City 
Industries,  460  U. S.,  at  435.  Absent  actual  competition 
with a favored Volvo dealer, however, Reeder cannot estab­
lish the competitive injury required under the Act. 
III 
The evidence Reeder offered at trial falls into three cate­
gories: (1) comparisons of concessions Reeder received for 
four successful bids against non-Volvo dealers, with larger 
concessions other successful Volvo dealers received for dif­
ferent  sales  on  which  Reeder  did  not  bid  (purchase­
to-purchase  comparisons);  (2)  comparisons  of  concessions 
offered to Reeder in connection with several unsuccessful 
bids  against  non-Volvo  dealers,  with  greater  concessions 
accorded  other  Volvo  dealers  who  competed  successfully 
for different sales on which Reeder did not bid (offer-to­

Opinion of the Court 
purchase comparisons); and (3) evidence of two occasions on 
which Reeder bid against another Volvo dealer (head-to-head 
comparisons).  The Court of Appeals concluded that Reeder 
demonstrated  competitive  injury  under  the  Act  because 
Reeder competed with favored purchasers “at the same func­
tional level . . . and within the same geographic market.” 
374 F. 3d, at 709 (quoting Best Brands, 842 F. 2d, at 585).  As 
we see it, however, selective comparisons of the kind Reeder 
presented do not show the injury to competition targeted by 
the Robinson-Patman Act. 
A 
Both the purchase-to-purchase and the offer-to-purchase 
comparisons fall short, for in none of the discrete instances 
on which Reeder relied did Reeder compete with beneﬁciar­
ies  of  the  alleged  discrimination  for  the  same  customer. 
Nor did Reeder even attempt to show that the compared 
dealers were consistently favored vis-a`-vis Reeder.  Reeder 
simply paired occasions on which it competed with non-Volvo 
dealers for a sale to Customer A with instances in which 
other Volvo dealers competed with non-Volvo dealers for a 
sale to Customer B.  The compared incidents were tied to 
no systematic study and were separated in time by as many 
as seven months.  See 374 F. 3d, at 706, 710. 
We decline to permit an inference of competitive injury 
from evidence of such a mix-and-match, manipulable quality. 
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34–35, 55.  No similar risk of manipula­
tion occurs in cases kin to the chainstore paradigm.  Here, 
there is no discrete “favored” dealer comparable to a chain­
store  or  a  large  independent  department  store—at  least, 
Reeder’s evidence is insufﬁcient to support an inference of 
such a dealer or set of dealers.  For all we know, Reeder, on 
occasion, might have gotten a better deal vis-a`-vis one or 
more of the dealers in its comparisons.  See supra, at 172. 
Reeder may have competed with other Volvo dealers for 
the opportunity  to bid  on potential sales  in a  broad geo­
graphic area.  At that initial stage, however, competition is
