Opinion of the Court
consumer.  This  so-called "reinsurance"  may serve  at least
two  purposes,  protecting  the  primary  insurer  from  cata-
strophic loss, and allowing the primary insurer to sell more
insurance  than  its  own  financial  capacity  might  otherwise
permit.  Id., at 17 (Cal. Complaint  29).  Thus, "[tihe avail-
ability of reinsurance  affects the ability and  willingness  of
primary insurers to provide  insurance  to their customers."
Id., at 18 (Cal. Complaint  34); id., at 63 (Conn. Complaint
4(p)).  Insurers who sell reinsurance themselves often pur-
chase insurance  to cover part of the risk they assume from
the primary insurer; such "retrocessional reinsurance"  does
for reinsurers  what reinsurance  does for primary insurers.
See ibid. (Conn. Complaint  4(r)).  Many of the defendants
here  are  reinsurers  or reinsurance  brokers,  or play  some
other specialized role in the reinsurance business; defendant

ation of domestic reinsurers.

The  prehistory of events  claimed  to give rise to liability
starts in  1977, when ISO began the  process of revising its
1973  CGL form.  Id., at 22 (Cal. Complaint  55).  For the
first time, it proposed two CGL forms (1984 ISO CGL forms),
one the traditional "occurrence" type, the other "with a new
'claims-made'  trigger."  Id., at 22-23  (Cal. Complaint  56).
The "claims-made" form did not have a retroactive date pro-
vision, however, and both 1984 forms covered "'sudden  and
accidental' pollution" damage and provided for unlimited cov-
erage of legal defense  costs by the insurer.  Id., at 23 (Cal.
Complaint  59-60).  Within the ISO,  defendant Hartford
Fire  Insurance  Company  objected  to  the  proposed  1984
forms; it desired elimination of the "occurrence" form, a ret-
roactive date provision on the "claims-made"  form, elimina-
tion of sudden and accidental pollution coverage, and a legal
defense  cost  cap.  Defendant  Allstate  Insurance  Company
also expressed  its desire for a retroactive  date provision on

the "claims-made"  form.  Id., at 24  (Cal. Complaint  61).
Majorities  in  the relevant  ISO  committees,  however,  sup-
ported  the  proposed  1984  CGL  forms  and  rejected  the
changes proposed  by Hartford and AllstatAe.  In  December
1983, the ISO Board of Directors approved the proposed 1984
forms, and ISO filed or lodged the forms with state regula-
tors in March 1984.  Ibid. (Cal. Complaint  16 2).
Dissatisfied with this state of affairs, the defendants began
to take other steps to force a change in the terms of coverage
of CGL insurance  generally available, steps that, the plain-
tiffs allege, implemented a series of conspiracies in violation
of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act.  The plaintiffs recount these steps
as a number of separate episodes corresponding to different
claims for relief in their complaints; 4 because it will become
important  to  distinguish  among  these counts  and  the acts
and  defendants  associated  with  them,  we  will  note  these
correspondences.
The  first four  Claims for  Relief in  the  California  Com-
plaint, id., at 36-43 (  111-130),  and the Second  Claim for
Relief in the Connecticut  Complaint, id., at 90-92 (  120-
124),  charge  the four  domestic  primary insurer defendants
and varying groups of domestic and foreign reinsurers, bro-
kers, and  associations  with  conspiracies  to  manipulate  the
ISO CGL forms.  In March  1984, primary insurer Hartford
persuaded  General  Reinsurance  Corporation  (General  Re),
the largest American reinsurer, to take steps either to pro-
cure desired changes in the ISO CGL forms, or "failing that,
[to]  'derail' the entire ISO CGL forms program."  Id., at 24
(Cal. Complaint  64).  General Re took up the matter with
its trade association,  RAA, which created a special commit-
tee  that met  and  agreed  to  "boycott"  the  1984  ISO  CGL
forms unless a retroactive-date  provision was  added to the

claims-made form, and a pollution exclusion and defense cost
cap were added to both forms.  Id., at 24-25 (Cal. Complaint
7765-66).  RAA  then  sent  a  letter to  ISO  "announc[ing]
that its members would  not provide  reinsurance  for cover-
ages written on the 1984 CGL forms,"  id., at 25 (Cal. Com-
plaint  67), and Hartford and General Re enlisted a domestic
reinsurance broker to give a speech to the ISO Board of Di-
rectors, in which he stated that no reinsurers would "break
ranks" to  reinsure  the  1984  ISO  CGL  forms.  Ibid. (Cal.
Complaint  68).
The  four  primary  insurer  defendants  (Hartford,  Aetna,
CIGNA, and Allstate) also encouraged key actors in the Lon-
don reinsurance  market, an  important provider of reinsur-
ance  for North American risks, to withhold  reinsurance  for
coverages  written  on  the  1984  ISO  CGL  forms.  Id.,  at
25-26  (Cal. Complaint  77 69-70).  As a  consequence,  many
London-based  underwriters,  syndicates,  brokers,  and  rein-
surance companies informed  ISO of their intention to with-
hold reinsurance on the 1984 forms, id., at 26-27 (Cal. Com-
plaint 77 71-75), and at least some of them told ISO that they
would  withhold reinsurance  until ISO incorporated  all four
desired  changes,  see supra, at 771,  and  n. 3,  into the  ISO
CGL forms.  App. 26 (Cal. Complaint  74).
For the first time ever, ISO invited representatives of the
domestic and foreign reinsurance markets to speak at an ISO
Executive  Committee  meeting.  Id.,  at  27-28  (Cal.  Com-
plaint  78).  At  that  meeting,  the  reinsurers  "presented
their agreed upon positions that there would be changes in
the CGL forms  or no  reinsurance."  Id., at 29  (Cal. Com-
plaint  82).  The  ISO Executive  Committee  then voted to
include a retroactive-date provision in the claims-made form,
and to exclude all pollution coverage from both new forms.
(But it neither eliminated the occurrence form, nor added a
legal defense cost cap.)  The 1984 ISO CGL forms were then
withdrawn  from the marketplace, and  replaced  with forms
(1986 ISO CGL forms) containing the new provisions.  Ibid.
