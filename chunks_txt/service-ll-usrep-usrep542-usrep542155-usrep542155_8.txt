176 F. H OFMAN-LA ROCHE LTD v. EMPAGRAN S. A . 
SCALIA, J., concuring in judgment 
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, con-
curing in the judgment. 
I c oncur in the judgment of the Court because the lan-
guage of the statute is readily susceptible of the interpreta-
tion the Court provides and because only that interpretation 
is consistent with the principle that statutes should be read 
in acord with the customary deference to the aplication of 
foreign countries' laws within their own teritories.
