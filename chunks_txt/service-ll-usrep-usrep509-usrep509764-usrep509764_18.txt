ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if
any other possible construction remains."  Murray v. Schoo-
ner Charming Betsy, 2  Cranch  64,  118  (1804)  (Marshall,
C. J.).  This canon is "wholly independent" of the presump-
tion  against  extraterritoriality.  Aramco,  supra,  at  264
(Marshall, J., dissenting).  It is relevant to determining the
substantive reach of a statute because  "the law of nations,"
or customary international law, includes limitations on a na-
tion's exercise of its jurisdiction to prescribe.  See Restate-
ment  (Third)  §§ 401-416.  Though  it  clearly  has  constitu-
tional authority to do so, Congress is generally presumed not
to have  exceeded  those  customary  international-law  limits
on jurisdiction to prescribe.
Consistent with that presumption,  this  and other  courts
have frequently recognized  that, even  where the presump-
tion  against  extraterritoriality  does  not  apply,  statutes
should not be interpreted to regulate foreign persons or con-
duct if that regulation would conflict with principles of inter-
national law.  For example, in Romero v. InternationalT er-
minal Operating Co.,  358  U. S.  354  (1959),  the  plaintiff, a
Spanish sailor who had been injured while working aboard a
Spanish-flag  and  Spanish-owned  vessel,  filed  a  Jones  Act
claim  against  his  Spanish  employer.  The  presumption
against  extraterritorial application  of federal  statutes  was
inapplicable to the case, as the actionable tort had occurred
in American  waters.  See id., at 383.  The Court nonethe-
less stated that, "in the absence  of a contrary congressional
direction,"  it would apply  "principles  of choice  of law  that
are consonant with the needs of a general federal maritime
law and  with due recognition  of our self-regarding respect
for the relevant interests of foreign nations in the regulation
of maritime  commerce  as part of the legitimate  concern of
the international  community."  Id., at 382-383.  "The  con-
trolling  considerations"  in  this  choice-of-law  analysis  were
"the interacting interests of the United States and of foreign
countries."  Id., at 383.

Romero referred to, and followed, the choice-of-law analy-
sis set forth in Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U. S. 571 (1953).  As
previously mentioned, Lauritzen also involved  a Jones Act
claim brought by a foreign sailor against a foreign employer.
The Lauritzen Court recognized the basic  problem: "If [the
Jones  Act  were] read  literally, Congress  has  conferred  an
American right of action which requires nothing more than
that plaintiff be 'any seaman who shall suffer personal injury
in the course of his employment."'  Id., at, 576.  The  solu-
tion it adopted  was to construe  the statute  "to  apply  only
to areas and transactions in which American law would be
considered operative under prevalent doctrines of interna-
tional law."  Id., at 577 (emphasis added).  To support ap-
plication of international  law to limit the facial  breadth  of
the statute, the Court relied upon-of course-Chief Justice
Marshall's  statement in Schooner Charming Betsy, quoted
supra,a t 814-815.  It then set forth "several factors which,
alone or in combination, are generally  conceded to influence
choice of law to govern a tort claim."  345 U. S., at 583;  see
id., at 583-593  (discussing factors).  See also McCulloch v.
Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10,
21-22  (1963)  (applying Schooner Charming Betsy principle
to  restrict application  of National  Labor  Relations  Act  to
foreign-flag  vessels).
Lauritzen, Romero, and McCulloch were maritime cases,
but we have recognized the principle that the scope of gener-
ally worded statutes must be construed in  light of interna-
tional law in other areas as well.  See, e. g., Sale v. Haitian
Centers Council, Inc.,  ante, at  178,  n.  35;  Weinberger v.
Rossi, 456 U. S.  25, 32 (1982).  More  specifically, the princi-
ple  was  expressed  in  United States  v. Aluminum  Co.  of
America, 148 F. 2d 416 (CA2 1945), the decision that estab-
lished the extraterritorial reach of the Sherman Act.  In his
opinion  for the  court, Judge  Learned  Hand  cautioned  "we
are not to read general words, such as those in [the Sherman]

Act, without regard to the limitations customarily observed
by  nations  upon  the  exercise  of their  powers;  limitations
which generally correspond to those fixed by the 'Conflict of
Laws."'  Id., at 443.
More recent lower court precedent has also tempered the
extraterritorial application  of the Sherman Act with consid-
erations of "international comity."  See Timberlane Lumber
Co. v. Bank of America, N. T & S. A., 549 F. 2d 597, 608-615
(CA9 1976); Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congo leum Corp., 595
F. 2d 1287,  1294-1298 (CA3 1979); Montreal Trading Ltd. v.
Amax  Inc., 661 F. 2d 864, 869-871 (CA10 1981); Laker Air-
ways Limited v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines, 235 U. S.
App. D. C. 207, 236, and n. 109, 731 F. 2d 909, 938, and n. 109
(1984);  see  also Pacific Seafarers, Inc. v. Pacific Far East
Line, Inc., 131  U. S. App. D. C. 226, 236, and n. 31, 404 F. 2d
804, 814,  and  n.  31  (1968).  The  "comity"  they  refer  to is
not the comity of courts, whereby judges decline to exercise
jurisdiction over matters more appropriately adjudged  else-
where, but rather what might be termed "prescriptive com-
ity": the respect sovereign nations afford each other by limit-
ing the  reach  of their laws.  That  comity  is  exercised  by
legislatures when they enact laws, and courts assume it has
been  exercised  when  they  come  to interpreting  the  scope
of laws  their legislatures  have enacted.  It is a traditional
component  of choice-of-law  theory.  See J. Story, Commen-
taries on the Conflict of Laws § 38 (1834)  (distinguishing be-
tween the "comity of the courts" and the "comity of nations,"
and defining the latter as "the true foundation and extent of
the obligation of the laws of one nation within the territories
of another").  Comity in  this  sense  includes  the choice-of-
law principles that, "in the absence of contrary congressional
direction,"  are assumed to be incorporated into our substan-
tive laws  having extraterritorial reach.  Romero, supra, at
382-383;  see  also  Lauritzen, supra, at  578-579;  Hilton v.
Guyot, 159 U. S.1 13, 162-166 (1895).  Considering comity in
