4  TEXACO INC. v. DAGHER 
Opinion of the Court 
markets.  Their business activities include reﬁning crude oil 
into gasoline, as well as marketing gasoline to downstream 
purchasers, such as the service stations represented in re­
spondents’ class action. 
In  1998,  Texaco  and  Shell  Oil  formed  a  joint  venture, 
Equilon,  to  consolidate  their  operations  in  the  western 
United States, thereby ending competition between the two 
companies in the domestic reﬁning and marketing of gaso­
line.  Under the joint venture agreement, Texaco and Shell 
Oil agreed to pool their resources and share the risks of and 
proﬁts from Equilon’s activities.  Equilon’s board of direc­
tors would comprise representatives of Texaco and Shell Oil, 
and Equilon gasoline would be sold to downstream purchas­
ers under the original Texaco and Shell Oil brand names. 
The formation of Equilon was approved by consent decree, 
subject to certain divestments and other modiﬁcations, by 
the Federal Trade Commission, see In re Shell Oil Co., 125 
F. T. C. 769 (1998), as well as by the state attorneys gen­
eral of California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington.  Nota­
bly, the decrees imposed no restrictions on the pricing of 
Equilon gasoline. 
After  the  joint  venture  began  to  operate,  respondents 
brought suit in District Court, alleging that, by unifying gas­
oline prices under the two brands, petitioners had violated 
the per se rule against price ﬁxing that this Court has long 
recognized under § 1 of the Sherman Act, ch. 647, 26 Stat. 
209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 1.  See, e. g., Catalano, Inc. v. 
Target Sales, Inc., 446 U. S. 643, 647 (1980) (per curiam). 
The District Court awarded summary judgment to Texaco 
and Shell Oil.  It determined that the rule of reason, rather 
than a per se rule or the quick look doctrine, governs re­
spondents’ claim, and that, by eschewing rule of reason anal­
ysis, respondents had failed to raise a triable issue of fact. 
The Ninth Circuit reversed, characterizing petitioners’ posi­
tion as a request for an “exception to the per se prohibition 
on  price-ﬁxing,”  and  rejecting  that  request.  Dagher  v.

Opinion of the Court 
Saudi Reﬁning, Inc., 369 F. 3d 1108, 1116 (2004).  We consol­
idated Texaco’s and Shell Oil’s separate petitions and granted 
certiorari to determine the extent to which the per se rule 
against price ﬁxing applies to an important and increasingly 
popular  form  of  business  organization,  the  joint  venture. 
545 U. S. 1138 (2005). 
II 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits “[e]very contract, 
combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.” 
15 U. S. C. § 1.  This Court has not taken a literal approach 
to this language, however.  See, e. g., State Oil Co. v. Khan, 
522 U. S. 3, 10 (1997) (“[T]his Court has long recognized that 
Congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints” 
(emphasis added)).  Instead, this Court presumptively ap­
plies rule of reason analysis, under which antitrust plaintiffs 
must demonstrate that a particular contract or combination 
is in fact unreasonable and anticompetitive before it will be 
found unlawful.  See, e. g., id., at 10–19.  Per se liability is 
reserved for only those agreements that are “so plainly anti­
competitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed 
to establish their illegality.”  National Soc. of Professional 
Engineers v.  United States, 435 U. S. 679, 692 (1978).  Ac­
cordingly, “we  have expressed  reluctance to adopt  per se 
rules . . . ‘where the economic impact of certain practices is 
not immediately obvious.’ ”  State Oil, supra, at 10 (quoting 
FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 458– 
459 (1986)). 
Price-ﬁxing agreements between two or more competitors, 
otherwise known as horizontal price-ﬁxing agreements, fall 
into the category of arrangements that are per se unlawful. 
See, e. g., Catalano, supra, at 647.  These cases do not pre­
sent such an agreement, however, because Texaco and Shell 
Oil did not compete with one another in the relevant mar­
ket—namely, the sale of gasoline to service stations in the 
western  United  States—but  instead  participated  in  that

Opinion of the Court 
market jointly through their investments in Equilon.1  In 
other words, the pricing policy challenged here amounts to 
little  more  than  price  setting  by  a  single  entity—albeit 
within  the  context  of  a  joint  venture—and  not  a  pricing 
agreement  between  competing  entities  with  respect  to 
their competing products.  Throughout Equilon’s existence, 
Texaco and Shell Oil shared in the proﬁts of Equilon’s activi­
ties in their role as investors, not competitors.  When “per­
sons who would otherwise be competitors pool their capital 
and share the risks of loss as well as the opportunities for 
proﬁt . . . such joint ventures [are] regarded as a single ﬁrm 
competing with other sellers in the market.”  Arizona v. 
Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 356 (1982). 
As such, though Equilon’s pricing policy may be price ﬁxing 
in a literal sense, it is not price ﬁxing in the antitrust sense. 
See Broadcast Music, Inc. v.  Columbia Broadcasting Sys­
tem, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 9 (1979) (“When two partners set the 
price of their goods or services they are literally ‘price ﬁx­
ing,’ but they are not per se in violation of the Sherman 
Act”). 
This conclusion is conﬁrmed by respondents’ apparent con­
cession that there would be no per se liability had Equilon 
simply chosen to sell its gasoline under a single brand.  See 
Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.  We see no reason to treat Equilon dif­
ferently just because it chose to sell gasoline under two dis­
1 We presume for purposes of these cases that Equilon is a lawful joint 
venture.  Its formation has been approved by federal and state regula­
tors, and there is no contention here that it is a sham.  As the court below 
noted: “There is a voluminous record documenting the economic justiﬁca­
tions for creating the joint ventures.  [T]he defendants concluded that 
numerous synergies and cost efﬁciencies would result” by creating Equilon 
as well as a parallel venture, Motiva Enterprises, in the eastern United 
States, and “that nationwide there would be up to $800 million in cost 
savings annually.”  369 F. 3d 1108, 1111 (CA9 2004).  Had respondents 
challenged Equilon itself, they would have been required to show that its 
creation was anticompetitive under the rule of reason.  See Copperweld 
Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 768 (1984).
