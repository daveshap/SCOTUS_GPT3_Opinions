Opinion of the Court 
“Per se condemnation—condemnation without inquiry 
into actual market conditions—is only appropriate if the 
existence of forcing is  probable.  Thus, application of 
the per se rule focuses on the probability of anticompeti­
tive consequences. . . .  
“For example, if the Government has granted the seller 
a patent or similar monopoly over a product, it is fair to 
presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere 
gives the seller market power.  United States v. Loew’s 
Inc.,  371  U. S.,  at  45–47.  Any  effort  to  enlarge  the 
scope of the patent monopoly by using the market power 
it confers to restrain competition in the market for a 
second product will undermine competition on the mer­
its in that second market.  Thus, the sale or lease of a 
patented item on condition that the buyer make all his 
purchases of a separate tied product from the patentee 
is unlawful.”  Id., at 13–16 (footnote omitted). 
Notably, nothing in our opinion suggested a rebuttable pre­
sumption of market power applicable to tying arrangements 
involving  a  patent  on  the  tying  good.  See  infra,  at  44; 
cf. 396 F. 3d, at 1352.  Instead, it described the rule that 
a contract to sell a patented product on condition that the 
purchaser buy unpatented goods exclusively from the pat­
entee is a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. 
Justice  O’Connor  wrote  separately  in  Jefferson  Parish, 
concurring in the judgment on the ground that the case did 
not involve a true tying arrangement because, in her view, 
surgical services and anesthesia were not separate products. 
466 U. S., at 43.  In her opinion, she questioned not only the 
propriety of treating any tying arrangement as a per se vio­
lation of the Sherman Act, id., at 35, but also the validity 
of the presumption that a patent always gives the patentee 
signiﬁcant market power, observing that the presumption 
was actually a product of our patent misuse cases rather than

Opinion of the Court 
our antitrust jurisprudence, id., at 37–38, n. 7.  It is that 
presumption, a vestige of the Court’s historical distrust of 
tying arrangements, that we address squarely today. 
III 
Justice O’Connor was, of course, correct in her assertion 
that the presumption that a patent confers market power 
arose outside the antitrust context as part of the patent mis­
use doctrine.  That doctrine had its origins in Motion Pic­
ture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502 
(1917), which found no support in the patent laws for the 
proposition  that  a  patentee  may  “prescribe  by  notice 
attached to a patented machine the conditions of its use and 
the supplies which must be used in the operation of it, under 
pain of infringement of the patent,” id., at 509.  Although 
Motion Picture Patents Co. simply narrowed the scope of 
possible patent infringement claims, it formed the basis for 
the Court’s subsequent decisions creating a patent misuse 
defense to infringement claims when a patentee uses its pat­
ent “as the effective means of restraining competition with 
its sale of an unpatented article.”  Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. 
Suppiger Co., 314 U. S. 488, 490 (1942); see also, e. g., Carbice 
Corp. of America v. American Patents Development Corp., 
283 U. S. 27, 31 (1931). 
Without any analysis of actual market conditions, these 
patent misuse decisions assumed that, by tying the purchase 
of unpatented goods to the sale of the patented good, the 
patentee was  “restraining competition,”  Morton Salt, 314 
U. S., at 490, or “secur[ing] a limited monopoly of an unpat­
ented material,” Mercoid, 320 U. S., at 664; see also Carbice, 
283 U. S., at 31–32.  In other words, these decisions pre­
sumed “[t]he requisite economic power” over the tying prod­
uct such that the patentee could “extend [its] economic con­
trol to unpatented products.”  Loew’s, 371 U. S., at 45–46. 
The presumption that a patent confers market power mi­
grated from patent law to antitrust law in International

Opinion of the Court 
Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392 (1947).  In that case, 
we afﬁrmed a District Court decision holding that leases of 
patented machines requiring the lessees to use the defend­
ant’s unpatented salt products violated § 1 of the Sherman 
Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act as a matter of law.  Id., at 
396.  Although the Court’s opinion does not discuss market 
power or the patent misuse doctrine, it assumes that “[t]he 
volume of business affected by these contracts cannot be said 
to be insigniﬁcant or insubstantial and the tendency of the 
arrangement  to  accomplishment  of  monopoly  seems  obvi­
ous.”  Ibid. 
The assumption that tying contracts “ten[d] . . . to  accom­
plishment of monopoly” can be traced to the Government’s 
brief in International Salt, which relied heavily on our ear­
lier patent misuse decision in Morton Salt.  The Govern­
ment described Morton Salt as “present[ing] a factual situa­
tion almost identical with the instant case,” and it asserted 
that “although the Court in that case did not ﬁnd it necessary 
to decide whether the antitrust laws were violated, its lan­
guage, its reasoning, and its citations indicate that the policy 
underlying the decision was the same as that of the Sherman 
Act.”  Brief for United States in International Salt Co. v. 
United States, O. T. 1947, No. 46, p. 19 (United States Brief). 
Building on its assertion that International Salt was logi­
cally indistinguishable from Morton Salt, the Government 
argued that this Court should place tying arrangements in­
volving patented products in the category of per se violations 
of the Sherman Act.  United States Brief 26–33. 
Our opinion in International Salt clearly shows that we 
accepted the Government’s invitation to import the presump­
tion of market power in a patented product into our antitrust 
jurisprudence.  While  we  cited  Morton Salt only  for  the 
narrower proposition that the defendant’s patents did not 
confer any right to restrain competition in unpatented salt or 
afford the defendant any immunity from the antitrust laws, 
International Salt, 332 U. S., at 395–396, given the fact that
