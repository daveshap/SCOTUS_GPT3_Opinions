OCTOBER  TERM,  1959.
Opinion of the Court.  361 U. S.
discretion  which  are  "material."  From a  thorough  ex-
amination of the record,  we are persuaded that the Com-
mission  has made  adequate  subsidiary  findings upon  all
material  issues and  has made  the  ultimate  findings  re-
quired  by  ยง 5 (2),  that they  support  the Commission's
order, and are, in turn, supported by substantial evidence.
Finally,  appellants  contend  that  the  District  Court,
because  of  inadequate  subsidiary  findings  by the  Com-
mission, was unable to, or at least did not, afford them a
proper judicial review, and merely "rubber stamped"  the
Comniission's  order.  Whether  or not we approve all  of
the reasons and legal conclusions of the District Court, it
is clear  that it fairly considered  and  decided  all of  the
issues raised by appellants,  accorded  to them a full and
fair judicial review, and reached a right result.  Accord-
ingly the judgment is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents.
