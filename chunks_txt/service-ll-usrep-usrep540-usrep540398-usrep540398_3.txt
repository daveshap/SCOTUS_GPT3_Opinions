Opinion of the Court
to make a "voluntary contribution" to the U. S. Treasury in
the amount of $3 million, 15 FCC Red. 5415, 5421,  16 (2000);
under the PSC orders, Verizon incurred liability to the com-
petitive LECs in the amount of $10 million.  Under the con-
sent decree  and orders, Verizon  was subjected to new per-
formance measurements  and new reporting requirements to
the FCC  and  PSC, with additional  penalties  for continued
noncompliance.  In June 2000, the FCC terminated the con-
sent decree.  Enforcement  Bureau Announces that Bell At-

Respondent Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, a New
York City law firm, was a local telephone service  customer
of AT&T.  The day after Verizon entered its consent decree
with  the FCC, respondent filed a complaint in the District
Court for the  Southern District of New York, on behalf of
itself and a class of similarly situated customers.  See App.
12-33.  The complaint,  as later amended,  id., at 34-50, al-
leged that Verizon had filled rivals'  orders on a discrimina-
tory basis as part of an anticompetitive scheme to discourage
customers from becoming or remaining customers of compet-
itive LECs, thus impeding the competitive  LECs' ability to
enter and compete in the market for local telephone service.
See,  e.g.,  id., at  34-35,  46-47, 1 1, 2,  52,  54.  According
to  the  complaint,  Verizon  "has  filled  orders  of  [competi-
tive  LEC]  customers  after  filling  those  for  its  own  local
phone service, has failed to fill in a timely manner, or not at
all,  a  substantial  number  of orders  for  [competitive  LEC]
customers...  , and has systematically failed to inform [com-

petitive  LECs]  of the  status  of their  customers'  orders."
Id., at 39,  21.  The complaint set forth a single example of
the alleged "failure to provide adequate access  to [competi-
tive  LECs],"  namely, the  OSS failure that  resulted  in  the
FCC consent  decree  and PSC orders.  Id., at 40,  22.  It
asserted that the result of Verizon's improper "behavior with
respect to providing access  to its local loop"  was to "deter
potential customers  [of rivals]  from switching."  Id., at 35,
47,  2, 57.  The complaint sought damages  and injunctive
relief for violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 2,
pursuant to the remedy provisions of §§ 4 and 16 of the Clay-
ton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §§ 15, 26.  The
complaint also alleged violations  of the 1996  Act, § 202(a) of
the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, as amended,
47 U. S. C. § 151 et seq., and state law.
The District Court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.
As  to the antitrust portion, it  concluded  that respondent's
allegations  of deficient  assistance  to rivals  failed  to satisfy
the requirements of § 2.  The Court of Appeals for the Sec-
ond Circuit reinstated  the complaint  in part, including  the
antitrust claim.  305 F. 3d 89, 113 (2002).  We granted cer-
tiorari, limited to the question whether the Court of Appeals
erred in reversing the District Court's dismissal of respond-
ent's antitrust claims.  538 U. S. 905 (2003).
II
To decide  this case, we must first determine what effect
(if any) the 1996 Act has upon the application  of traditional
antitrust principles.  The Act imposes a large number of du-
ties upon  incumbent  LECs-above  and beyond  those basic
responsibilities it imposes upon all carriers, such as assuring
number portability and providing access to rights-of-way, see
47  U. S. C.  §§ 251(b)(2),  (4).  Under  the  sharing  duties  of
§251(c),  incumbent  LECs are required  to offer  three kinds
of access.  Already noted, and perhaps most intrusive, is the
duty to offer access to UNEs on "just, reasonable, and non-

discriminatory" terms, § 251(c)(3), a phrase that the FCC has
interpreted to mean a price reflecting long-run incremental
cost.  See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S.,
at 495-496.  A rival can interconnect its own facilities with
those of the incumbent LEC, or it can simply purchase serv-
ices at wholesale from the incumbent and resell them to con-
sumers.  See  §§251(c)(2),  (4).  The  Act also  imposes  upon
incumbents the duty to allow physical "collocation"-that is,
to permit a competitor to locate and install its equipment on
the  incumbent's  premises-which  makes  feasible  intercon-
nection and access to UNEs.  See §251(c)(6).
That Congress created these duties, however, does not au-
tomatically lead to the conclusion  that they can be enforced
by means of an antitrust claim.  Indeed, a detailed regula-
tory scheme such as that created by the 1996 Act ordinarily
raises  the question  whether the regulated  entities  are not
shielded from  antitrust scrutiny altogether by the doctrine
of implied immunity.  See, e. g.,  United States v. National
Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 422 U. S. 694 (1975);  Gor-
don v. New York  Stock Exchange, Inc., 422 U. S. 659 (1975).
In some respects the enforcement scheme set up by the 1996
Act is a good candidate for implication of antitrust immunity,
to avoid the real possibility of judgments conflicting with the
agency's regulatory scheme "that might be voiced by courts
exercising  jurisdiction under  the antitrust  laws."  United
States v. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., supra,
at 734.
Congress,  however,  precluded  that interpretation.  Sec-
tion 601(b)(1)  of the 1996 Act is an antitrust-specific saving
clause providing that "nothing in this Act or the amendments
made by this  Act shall  be construed  to modify, impair,  or
supersede  the  applicability  of any  of the  antitrust laws."
110 Stat. 143, 47 U. S. C. § 152,  note.  This bars a finding of
implied immunity.  As the FCC has put the point, the saving
clause preserves  those "claims that satisfy established  anti-
trust standards."  Brief for United  States and  the Federal
