tional charges  took the form  of (1) investor  promises “to 
place bids . . . in the aftermarket at prices above the IPO 
price” (i. e., “laddering” agreements); (2) investor “commit­
ments  to  purchase  other,  less  attractive  securities”  (i. e., 
“tying” arrangements); and (3) investor payment of “non­
competitively  determined”  (i. e.,  excessive)  “commissions,” 
including the “purchas[e] of an issuer’s shares in follow-up or 
‘secondary’  public  offerings  (for  which  the  underwriters 
would earn underwriting discounts).”  Id., at 12–13.  The 
complaint added that the underwriters’ agreement to engage 
in some or all of these practices artiﬁcially inﬂated the share 
prices of the securities in question.  Id., at 32. 
The underwriters moved to dismiss the investors’ com­
plaints on the ground that federal securities law impliedly 
precludes  application  of  antitrust  laws  to  the  conduct  in 
question.  (The antitrust laws at issue include the commer­
cial bribery provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act.)  The 
District  Court  agreed  with  petitioners  and  dismissed  the 
complaints against them.  See In re Initial Public Offering 
Antitrust Litigation, 287 F. Supp. 2d 497, 524–525 (SDNY 
2003) (IPO Antitrust).  The Court of Appeals for the Sec­
ond  Circuit  reversed,  however,  and  reinstated  the  com­
plaints.  426 F. 3d 130, 170, 172 (2005).  We granted the un­
derwriters’ petition for certiorari.  And we now reverse the 
judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Sometimes  regulatory  statutes  explicitly  state  whether 
they preclude application of the antitrust laws.  Compare, 
e. g., Webb-Pomerene Act, 15 U. S. C. § 62 (expressly provid­
ing antitrust immunity), with § 601(b)(1) of the Telecommuni­
cations Act of 1996, 47 U. S. C. § 152 (stating that antitrust 
laws remain applicable).  See also Verizon Communications 
Inc. v. Law Ofﬁces of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U. S. 398, 
406–407 (2004) (analyzing the antitrust saving clause of the

Opinion of the Court 
Telecommunications  Act).  Where  regulatory  statutes  are 
silent in respect to antitrust, however, courts must deter­
mine whether, and in what respects, they implicitly preclude 
application of the antitrust laws.  Those determinations may 
vary from statute to statute, depending upon the relation 
between the antitrust laws and the regulatory program set 
forth in the particular statute, and the relation of the speciﬁc 
conduct at issue to both sets of laws.  Compare Gordon, 422 
U. S., at 689 (ﬁnding implied preclusion of antitrust laws); 
and  NASD,  422  U. S.,  at  729–730  (same),  with  Otter  Tail 
Power  Co.  v.  United States, 410 U. S. 366, 374–375 (1973) 
(ﬁnding no implied immunity); Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 
U. S., at 352 (same); and Silver, 373 U. S., at 360 (same).  See 
also Phonetele, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 664 F. 2d 
716, 727 (CA9 1981). 
Three decisions from this Court speciﬁcally address the 
relation  of  securities  law  to  antitrust  law.  In  Silver  the 
Court considered a dealer’s claim that, by expelling him from 
the New York Stock Exchange, the exchange had violated 
the  antitrust  prohibition  against  group  “boycott[s].”  373 
U. S., at 347.  The Court wrote that, where possible, courts 
should “reconcil[e] the operation of both [i. e., antitrust and 
securities] statutory schemes . . . rather than holding one 
completely ousted.”  Id., at 357.  It also set forth a stand­
ard, namely, that “[r]epeal [of the antitrust laws] is to be re­
garded as implied only if necessary to make the Securities 
Exchange Act work, and even then only to the minimum ex­
tent necessary.”  Ibid.  And it held that the securities law 
did  not  preclude  application  of  the  antitrust  laws  to  the 
claimed boycott insofar as the exchange denied the expelled 
dealer a right to fair procedures.  Id., at 359–360. 
In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that the SEC 
lacked jurisdiction under the securities law “to review par­
ticular  instances  of  enforcement  of  exchange  rules”;  that 
“nothing [was] built into the regulatory scheme which per­
forms the antitrust function of insuring” that rules that in­

Opinion of the Court 
jure competition are nonetheless “justiﬁed as furthering” le­
gitimate regulatory “ends”; that the expulsion “would 
clearly” violate “the Sherman Act unless justiﬁed by refer­
ence to the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act”; and 
that it could ﬁnd no such justifying purpose where the ex­
change took “anticompetitive collective action . . .  without 
according fair procedures.”  Id., at 357–358, 364 (emphasis 
added). 
In Gordon  the Court considered an  antitrust complaint 
that essentially alleged “price ﬁxing” among stockbrokers. 
It charged that members of the New York Stock Exchange 
had agreed to ﬁx their commissions on sales under $500,000. 
And it sought damages and an injunction forbidding future 
agreements.  422 U. S., at 661, and n. 3.  The lawsuit was 
ﬁled at a time when regulatory attitudes toward ﬁxed stock­
broker commissions were changing.  The ﬁxed commissions 
challenged in the complaint were applied during a period 
when the SEC approved of the practice of ﬁxing broker­
commission rates.  But Congress and the SEC had both sub­
sequently disapproved for the future the ﬁxing of some of 
those rates.  See id., at 690–691. 
In deciding whether antitrust liability could lie, the Court 
repeated  Silver’s  general  standard  in  somewhat  different 
terms: It said that an “implied repeal” of the antitrust laws 
would be found only “where there is a ‘plain repugnancy be­
tween the antitrust and regulatory provisions.’ ”  422 U. S., 
at 682 (quoting Philadelphia Nat. Bank, supra, at 350–351). 
It then held that the securities laws impliedly precluded ap­
plication  of  the  antitrust  laws  in  the  case  at  hand.  The 
Court rested this conclusion on three sets of considerations. 
For one thing, the securities law “gave the SEC direct regu­
latory power over exchange rules and practices with respect 
to the ﬁxing of reasonable rates of commission.”  422 U. S., 
at 685 (internal quotation marks omitted).  For another, the 
SEC had “taken an active role in review of proposed rate 
changes during the last 15 years,” and had engaged in “con­
