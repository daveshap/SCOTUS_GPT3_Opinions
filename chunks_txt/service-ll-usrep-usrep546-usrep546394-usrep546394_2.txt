Opinion of the Court 
I 
The genesis of the underlying litigation in this case was 
ConAgra’s attempt to enforce its patent for “A Method for 
Browning Precooked Whole Muscle Meat Products,” U. S. 
Patent No. 5,952,027 (’027 patent).  In early 2000, ConAgra 
issued a general warning to companies who sold equipment 
and processes for browning precooked meats explaining that 
it intended to “ ‘aggressively protect all of [its] rights under 
[the ’027] patent.’ ”  375 F. 3d 1341, 1344 (CA Fed. 2004). 
Petitioner Unitherm sold such processes, but did not receive 
ConAgra’s warning.  ConAgra also contacted its direct com­
petitors in the precooked meat business, announcing that it 
was “ ‘making the ’027 Patent and corresponding patents that 
may issue available for license at a royalty rate of 10¢ per 
pound.’ ”  Id.,  at  1345.  Jennie-O,  a direct  competitor,  re­
ceived ConAgra’s correspondence and undertook an inves­
tigation  to  determine  its  rights  and  responsibilities  with 
regard  to  the  ’027  patent.  Jennie-O  determined  that  the 
browning process it had purchased from Unitherm was the 
same as the process described in the ’027 patent.  Jennie-O 
further determined that the ’027 patent was invalid because 
Unitherm’s  president  had  invented  the  process  described 
in  that  patent  six  years  before  ConAgra  ﬁled  its  patent 
application. 
Consistent with these determinations, Jennie-O and Uni­
therm jointly sued ConAgra in the Western District of Okla­
homa.  As relevant here, Jennie-O and Unitherm sought a 
declaration that the ’027 patent was invalid and unenforce­
able, and alleged that ConAgra had violated § 2 of the Sher­
man Act, ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 2, by 
attempting to enforce a patent that was obtained by commit­
ting fraud on the Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce (PTO).  See 
Walker  Process  Equipment,  Inc.  v.  Food  Machinery  & 
Chemical Corp., 382 U. S. 172, 174 (1965) (holding that “the 
enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent 
Ofﬁce may be violative of § 2 of the Sherman Act provided

Opinion of the Court 
the  other  elements  necessary  to  a  § 2  case  are  present”). 
The District Court construed the ’027 patent and determined 
that it was invalid based on Unitherm’s prior public use and 
sale of the process described therein.  35 U. S. C. § 102(b). 
After dismissing Jennie-O for lack of antitrust standing, the 
District Court allowed Unitherm’s Walker Process claim to 
proceed to trial.  Prior to the court’s submission of the case 
to the jury, ConAgra moved for a directed verdict under 
Rule 50(a) based on legal insufﬁciency of the evidence.  The 
District Court denied that motion.1  The jury returned a 
verdict for Unitherm, and ConAgra neither renewed its mo­
tion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), 
nor moved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant to 
Rule 59.2 
On  appeal  to  the  Federal  Circuit,  ConAgra  maintained 
that  there  was  insufﬁcient  evidence  to  sustain  the  jury’s 
Walker Process verdict.  Although the Federal Circuit has 
concluded that a party’s “failure to present the district court 
with a post-verdict motion precludes appellate review of suf­
ﬁciency of the evidence,” Biodex Corp. v. Loredan Biomedi­
cal, Inc., 946 F. 2d 850, 862 (1991), in the instant case it was 
bound to apply the law of the Tenth Circuit, 375 F. 3d, at 
1365, n. 7 (“On most issues related to Rule 50 motions . . . 
we generally apply regional circuit law unless the precise 
1 Petitioner contends that respondent’s Rule 50(a) motion pertained only 
to the fraud element of petitioner’s Walker Process claim, and that it did 
not encompass the remaining antitrust elements of that claim.  Because 
we conclude that petitioner is entitled to prevail irrespective of the scope 
of respondent’s Rule 50(a) motion, we assume without deciding that that 
motion pertained to all aspects of petitioner’s § 2 claim.  But see Amend­
ments to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 134 F. R. D. 525, 687 (1991) 
(“A post-trial motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds ad­
vanced in the pre-verdict motion”). 
2 While ConAgra did ﬁle a postverdict motion seeking a new trial on 
antitrust damages, that motion did not seek to challenge the sufﬁciency of 
the evidence establishing antitrust liability and thus has no bearing on the 
instant case.

Opinion of the Court 
issue  being  appealed  pertains  uniquely  to  patent  law”). 
Under Tenth Circuit law, a party that has failed to ﬁle a 
postverdict  motion  challenging  the  sufﬁciency  of  the  evi­
dence may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long 
as that party ﬁled a Rule 50(a) motion prior to submission of 
the case to the jury.  Cummings v. General Motors Corp., 
365 F. 3d 944, 950–951 (2004).  Notably, the only available 
relief in such a circumstance is a new trial.  Id., at 951. 
Freed to examine the sufﬁciency of the evidence, the Fed­
eral  Circuit  concluded  that,  although  Unitherm  had  pre­
sented sufﬁcient evidence to support a determination that 
ConAgra had attempted to enforce a patent that it had ob­
tained through fraud on the PTO, 375 F. 3d, at 1362, Uni­
therm had failed to present evidence sufﬁcient to support 
the remaining elements of its antitrust claim.  Id., at 1365 
(“Unitherm failed to present any economic evidence capable 
of  sustaining  its  asserted  relevant  antitrust  market,  and 
little to support any other aspect of its Section 2 claim”). 
Accordingly, it vacated the jury’s judgment in favor of Uni­
therm and remanded for a new trial.  We granted certiorari, 
543 U. S. 1186 (2005), and now reverse.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 sets forth the proce­
dural requirements for challenging the sufﬁciency of the evi­
dence in a civil jury trial and establishes two stages for such 
challenges—prior to submission of the case to the jury, and 
after the verdict and entry of judgment.  Rule 50(a) allows 
a party to challenge the sufﬁciency of the evidence prior to 
submission of the case to the jury, and authorizes the district 
court to grant such motions at the court’s discretion: 
“(a) Judgment as a Matter of Law. 
“(1) If during a trial by jury a party has been fully 
heard on an issue and there is no legally sufﬁcient evi­
dentiary basis for a reasonable jury to ﬁnd for that party 
on that issue, the court may determine the issue against
