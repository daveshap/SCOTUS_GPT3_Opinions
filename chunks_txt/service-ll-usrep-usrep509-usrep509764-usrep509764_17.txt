HARTFORD FIRE INS. CO. v. CALIFORNIA
SCALIA, J., dissenting
II
Petitioners  in  No.  91-1128,  various  British  corporations
and other British subjects, argue that certain of the claims
against them constitute an inappropriate extraterritorial ap-
plication of the Sherman Act."  It is important to distinguish
two distinct questions  raised  by this petition:  whether the
District  Court had jurisdiction,  and whether  the Sherman
Act  reaches  the extraterritorial  conduct  alleged here.  On
the  first  question,  I  believe  that  the  District  Court  had
subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  the  Sherman  Act  claims
against all the defendants  (personal jurisdiction  is not con-
tested).  Respondents  asserted  nonfrivolous  claims  under
the Sherman Act, and 28 U. S. C. § 1331 vests district courts
with subject-matter jurisdiction  over cases  "arising under"
federal  statutes.  As  precedents  such  as  Lauritzen  v.
Larsen, 345 U. S. 571  (1953), make clear, that is sufficient to
establish the District Court's jurisdiction over these claims.
Lauritzen involved  a Jones Act claim brought by a foreign
sailor  against  a  foreign  shipowner.  The  shipowner  con-
tested the District Court's jurisdiction, see id., at 573, appar-
ently on the grounds that the Jones Act did not govern the
dispute between the foreign parties to the action.  Though
ultimately agreeing with the shipowner that the Jones Act
did not apply, see discussion  infra, at 816., the Court held
that the District Court had jurisdiction.
"As frequently happens, a contention that there is some
barrier to granting plaintiff's  claim is cast in terms  of
an exception to jurisdiction of subject matter.  A cause
of action under our law was asserted here, and the court
had power to determine whether it was or was not well
founded in law and in fact."  345 U. S., at 575.
8The counts at issue in this litigation are the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth
Claims  for Relief in the California Complaint.  See App. 43-46 (  131-
140), id., at 47-49 (1  146-150).

The  second  question-the  extraterritorial  reach  of  the
Sherman Act-has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the
courts.  It  is  a  question  of  substantive  law  turning  on
whether, in  enacting  the Sherman  Act,  Congress  asserted
regulatory power over the challenged conduct.  See EEOC
v. Arabian American Oil  Co.,  499  U.S.  244,  248  (1991)
(Aramco) ("It is  our task to determine  whether Congress
intended  the  protections  of  Title  VII  to  apply  to  United
States citizens employed by American employers outside of
the  United  States").  If a  plaintiff fails  to prevail  on  this
issue,  the  court  does  not  dismiss  the  claim  for  want  of
subject-matter  jurisdiction-want  of  power  to  adjudicate;
rather, it decides  the claim,  ruling on  the merits that  the
plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action under the rele-
vant statute.  See Romero, supra, at 384 (holding no claim
available  under  the  Jones  Act);  American Banana Co. v.
United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 359 (1909) (holding that com-
plaint based upon foreign conduct "alleges no case under the
[Sherman Act]").
There  is, however, a type of "jurisdiction" relevant to de-
termining the extraterritorial reach of a statute; it is known
as "legislative jurisdiction," Aramco, supra, at 253; Restate-
ment (First) Conflict of Laws § 60 (1934),  or "jurisdiction to
prescribe,"  1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law
of the  United  States  235  (1987)  (hereinafter  Restatement
(Third)).  This refers to "the authority of a state to make its
law applicable to persons or activities,"  and is quite a sepa-
rate matter from "jurisdiction to adjudicate,"  see id., at 231.
There is no doubt, of course, that Congress possesses legisla-
tive jurisdiction over the acts alleged in this complaint: Con-
gress has broad power under Article I, § 8, cl. 3, "[t]o  regulate
Commerce with foreign Nations," and this Court has repeat-
edly upheld  its power  to make  laws  applicable  to persons
or activities beyond our territorial boundaries where United

States interests are affected.  See Ford v. United States, 273
U. S. 593, 621-623 (1927);  United States v. Bowman, 260 U. S.
94, 98-99 (1922); American Banana,s upra, at 356.  But the
question  in this  litigation  is  whether, and  to what extent,
Congress  has exercised that undoubted legislative jurisdic-
tion in enacting the Sherman Act.
Two canons of statutory construction are relevant in this
inquiry.  The first is the "longstanding principle of American
law 'that  legislation  of Congress,  unless  a contrary  intent
appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial juris-
diction of the United States."'  Aramco, supra,a t 248 (quot-
ing Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336  U. S. 281,  285  (1949)).
Applying that canon in Aramco, we held that the version of
Title VII of the  Civil  Rights Act of 1964  then in force,  42
U. S. C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17  (1988  ed.), did not extend out-
side the territory of the United States even though the stat-
ute contained broad provisions extending its prohibitions to,
for example,  "'any  activity, business,  or  industry  in  com-
merce.'  Id.,  at  249  (quoting 42  U. S. C.  § 2000e(h)).  We
held such "boilerplate language" to be an insufficient indica-
tion to override the presumption against extraterritoriality.
Id., at 251; see also id., at 251-253.  The Sherman Act con-
tains similar "boilerplate language," and if the question were
not governed  by precedent,  it would be worth  considering
whether that presumption  controls  the outcome here.  We
have, however, found the presumption to be overcome  with
respect to our antitrust laws; it is now well established that
the Sherman Act applies extraterritorially.  See Matsushita
Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475  U. S.  574,
582,  n.  6  (1986);  Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide &
Carbon Corp., 370  U. S.  690,  704  (1962);  see  also  United
States v. Aluminum  Co. of America, 148  F. 2d  416  (CA2
1945).
But if the presumption against extraterritoriality has been
overcome or is otherwise inapplicable, a second canon of stat-
utory construction becomes  relevant:  "[A]n  act of congress
