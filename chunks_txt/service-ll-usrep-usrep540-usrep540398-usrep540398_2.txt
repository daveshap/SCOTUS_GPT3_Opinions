Opinion of the Court
JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Telecommunications  Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110
Stat. 56,  imposes  certain duties  upon  incumbent local  tele-
phone companies in order to facilitate market entry by com-
petitors, and  establishes  a  complex  regime for  monitoring
and enforcement.  In this case we consider  whether a com-
plaint alleging breach of the incumbent's duty under the 1996
Act  to  share  its network  with  competitors  states  a  claim
under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209.

402  VERIZON  COMMUNICATIONS  INC. v. LAW OFFICES
OF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLP
Opinion of the Court
I
Petitioner Verizon  Communications  Inc. is the incumbent
local exchange carrier (LEC) serving New York State.  Be-
fore the 1996 Act, Verizon,'  like other incumbent LECs, en-
joyed  an  exclusive  franchise  within  its  local  service  area.
The 1996 Act sought to "uproo[t]"  the incumbent LECs' mo-
nopoly  and  to  introduce  competition  in  its place.  Verizon
Communications Inc. v.  FCC, 535  U. S.  467,  488  (2002).
Central  to the  scheme  of the  Act is the incumbent  LEC's
obligation under 47 U. S. C. § 251(c) to share its network with
competitors,  see  AT&T  Corp. v.  Iowa  Utilities Bd.,  525
U. S. 366,  371  (1999),  including  provision  of access  to indi-
vidual  elements  of the  network  on  an  "unbundled"  basis.
§251(c)(3).  New entrants,  so-called  competitive  LECs, re-
sell these unbundled network elements  (UNEs), recombined
with each other or with elements belonging to the LECs.
Verizon,  like other  incumbent  LECs,  has taken  two  sig-
nificant  steps  within  the Act's  framework  in  the direction
of increased competition.  First, Verizon  has signed  inter-
connection  agreements  with rivals  such  as AT&T, as  it  is
obliged to do under § 252, detailing the terms on which it will
make its network elements available.  (Because Verizon and
AT&T could not agree upon terms, the open issues were sub-
jected to compulsory arbitration under §§ 252(b) and (c).)  In
1997, the  state regulator, New York's  Public  Service Com-
mission  (PSC),  approved  Verizon's  interconnection  agree-
ment with AT&T.
Second,  Verizon has  taken advantage  of the opportunity
provided  by  the  1996  Act  for  incumbent  LECs  to  enter
the  long-distance  market  (from which  they  had  long been
excluded).  That  required  Verizon  to  satisfy, among  other
things, a 14-item  checklist of statutory requirements, which
'In  1996,  NYNEX  was  the incumbent  LEC  for  New  York  State.
NYNEX  subsequently  merged  with Bell Atlantic  Corporation,  and the
merged entity retained the Bell Atlantic name; a further merger produced
Verizon.  We use "Verizon" to refer to NYNEX and Bell Atlantic as well.

Opinion of the Court
includes  compliance  with the Act's network-sharing  duties.
§§ 271(d)(3)(A) and (c)(2)(B).  Checklist item two, for exam-
ple,  includes  "[n]ondiscriminatory  access  to  network  ele-
ments  in  accordance  with  the requirements"  of §251(c)(3).
§ 271(c)(2)(B)(ii).  Whereas  the state regulator  approves an
interconnection agreement, for long-distance approval the in-
cumbent LEC applies to the Federal Communications  Com-
mission (FCC).  In December 1999, the FCC approved Veri-
zon's § 271 application for New York.
Part of Verizon's  UNE  obligation  under § 251(c)(3) is the
provision  of access  to operations  support systems  (OSS), a
set of systems used by incumbent LECs to provide services
to customers and ensure quality.  Verizon's interconnection
agreement and long-distance authorization each specified the
mechanics  by which its  OSS obligation would  be met.  As
relevant  here, a  competitive  LEC  sends orders  for service
through an electronic interface  with Verizon's ordering  sys-
tem,  and  as Verizon  completes  certain  steps  in filling  the
order, it sends confirmation back through the same interface.
Without OSS access a rival cannot fill its customers' orders.
In late 1999,  competitive  LECs complained to regulators
that many  orders were  going unfilled, in violation of Veri-
zon's  obligation  to provide  access  to  OSS  functions.  The
PSC and FCC opened parallel investigations, which led to a
series of orders by the PSC  and a consent decree with the
FCC.2  Under the FCC consent  decree, Verizon undertook
